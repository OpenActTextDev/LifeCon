# Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Goal

The goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. The text *Loss Data Analytics* represents our first book.  

## Loss Data Analytics

### Book Description
*Loss Data Analytics* is be an interactive, online, freely available text.

* A subset of the book is available for offline reading in pdf and EPUB formats.
* The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience.

To see our progress, a current version of the book is available at [Online Version](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html)
