The online version contains many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning. A subset of the book is available for offline reading in pdf and EPUB formats. The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience. What will success look like? The online text will be freely available to a worldwide audience. The online version will contain many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning. Moreover, a subset of the book will be available in pdf format for low-cost printing. The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience. How will the text be used? This book will be useful in actuarial curricula worldwide. It will cover the loss data learning objectives of the major actuarial organizations. Thus, it will be suitable for classroom use at universities as well as for use by independent learners seeking to pass professional actuarial examinations. Moreover, the text will also be useful for the continuing professional development of actuaries and other professionals in insurance and related financial risk management industries. Why is this good for the profession? An online text is a type of open educational resource (OER). One important benefit of an OER is that it equalizes access to knowledge, thus permitting a broader community to learn about the actuarial profession. Moreover, it has the capacity to engage viewers through active learning that deepens the learning process, producing analysts more capable of solid actuarial work. Why is this good for students and teachers and others involved in the learning process? Cost is often cited as an important factor for students and teachers in textbook selection (see a recent post on the $400 textbook). Students will also appreciate the ability to “carry the book around” on their mobile devices. Project Goal The project goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. To get involved, please visit our Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site.

Contributors The project goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. The following contributors have taken a leadership role in developing Life Contingencies. Vali Asimit Dani Bauer Adam Butt Emiliano Valdez Edward W. (Jed) Frees is an emeritus professor, formerly the Hickman-Larson Chair of Actuarial Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He is a Fellow of both the Society of Actuaries and the American Statistical Association. He has published extensively (a four-time winner of the Halmstad and Prize for best paper published in the actuarial literature) and has written three books. He also is a co-editor of the two-volume series Predictive Modeling Applications in Actuarial Science published by Cambridge University Press. Reviewers Our goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. Part of the writing process will involve many reviewers to help make this book better. For our Readers We hope that you find this book worthwhile and even enjoyable. For your convenience, at our Github Landing site (https://openacttexts.github.io/), In developing this book, we are emphasizing the online version that has lots of great features such as a glossary, code and solutions to examples that you can be revealed interactively. For example, you will find that the statistical code is hidden and can only be seen by clicking on terms such as R Code for Frequency Table Insample &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Insample.csv&quot;, header=T, na.strings=c(&quot;.&quot;), stringsAsFactors=FALSE) Insample2010 &lt;- subset(Insample, Year==2010) table(Insample2010$Freq) We hide the code because we don’t want to insist that you use the R statistical software (although we like it). Still, we encourage you to try some statistical code as you read the book – we have opted to make it easy to learn R as you go. We have set up a separate R Code for Loss Data Analytics site to explain more of the details of the code. Like any book, we have a set of notations and conventions. It will probably save you time if you regularly visit our Appendix Chapter ?? to get used to ours. Freely available, interactive textbooks represent a new venture in actuarial education and we need your input. Although a lot of effort has gone into the development, we expect hiccoughs. Please let your instructor know about opportunities for improvement, write us through our project site, or contact chapter contributors directly with suggested improvements. "],
["chapter-3-examples-present-values.html", "Chapter 3 Examples – Present Values Examples – Valuation of cash flows under uncertainty", " Chapter 3 Examples – Present Values Examples – Valuation of cash flows under uncertainty Editorial Note: These are the results of experimentation with the “jExcel” javascript package for dynamic spreadsheets that utilizes the “Highcharts” package for dynamic graphs. Example 3.1.1. Varying Payments and Rates of Interest Let us review some basic concepts regarding present value of payments made with certainty (no randomness) of payments under potentially varying rates of interest. The first basic concept is that payments made in the near future have greater present value than those made in the distant future. The second basic concept is that interest rates in the near future have greater effect on present values than those in the distant future. To illustrate, we consider \\(T=12\\) payments at times \\(1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\). Payment may be constant (or “flat”) at 11 in this example, or varying. For the varying payments, this example uses increasing payments, \\(0, 2, \\ldots, 22\\) so the average of increasing payments is 11. For interest rates, we consider a flat rate \\(i= 0.055\\) with varying (increasing) rates \\(0, 0.01, \\ldots, 0.11\\), so the average interest rate is 0.055. If you want to think about these as monthly rates, you may use the Interest Rate Multiplier cell in Table 3.1 to change the rates. For example, if you make the cell B12 equal to 0.1, then flat rate changes to \\(i= 0.0055\\) that may be more suitable for a monthly rate. Editorial Note: As coded now, the ‘Interest Rate Multiplier’ works but takes a couple of minutes. Get some coffee if you change this cell. Changing other parts of the spreadsheet is quick. You can double-click on a cell to see how it is coded. You can drag a column separator to widen the cell to see the coding. Table 3.1 shows the patterns of varying the payments and the rates of interest supported by a graphical display in Figure 3.1. Here, we see that, for both flat and varying payments, the present values for increasing interest rates are greater than those for the flat ones. This underscores the second concept, that present values in the near term are more important than those in the future. We can also see the sums of present values in column N of Table 3.1. This shows that, for both flat and increasing interest rates, that flat payments have a larger present value than increasing payments. This underscores the second concept, that payments made in the near future have a greater impact than those in the distant future. On Your Own. You can download the spreadsheet data with the Export this spreadsheet as CSV button and manipulate it using as spreadsheet program, such as Excel. Alternatively, you can create the data using the code provided in the R Code For VaryingPayments segment that follows. Using either, or both, approaches, experiment with alternative patterns of varying payments and interest rates to enhance your appreciation for the nuances of present values of varying payments.

Varying Payments and Rates of Interest With Uncertainty We now revisit Example 3.1.1 but assume that payments are uncertain, that is, random with a given probability distribution. In Chapter 2 we learned how to develop complex probability distributions that will be useful in our study of contingent life events. For this example, we make some simple assumptions to get started. Specifically, we assume a constant probability (uniform) distribution; with \\(T=12\\) periods, this means that there is a \\(\\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.0833\\) probability of a payment at any specific time period. To vary this, we follow Example 3.1.1 and assume probabilities that are linear increasing, as shown in Table 3.2. From Table 3.2, we can see that we now have 8 different scenarios based on 2 for payments, 2 for interest rates, and 2 for probabilities, in each case flat versus increasing. Discounted values weighted by probabilities appear in rows 11-14 and 16-19. A plot corresponding to increasing probabilities (rows 16-19) appears in Figure 3.2. Note that a plot using constant probabilities would be exactly as in Figure 3.1 except for the constant probability weight \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\). On Your Own. Download the spreadsheet data with the Export this spreadsheet as CSV button or access the R code with the segment R Code For VaryingPayments with Uncertainty. Compare the means values (column N of the spreadsheet) among the 8 scenarios and interpret them, as you might for a client. Further, you will get a greater appreciation of the uncertainty by calculating the corresponding standard deviations. Table 3.2.

Further, when we use the “pagination” option to reduce the size of a table, dynamic graphs becomes hard (although the dynamic tables are still really easy). 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 "],
