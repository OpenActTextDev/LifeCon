[["index.html", "Life Contingencies: The Mathematics, Statistics, and Economics of Life Insurance Preface Acknowledgements Contributors For our Readers", " Life Contingencies: The Mathematics, Statistics, and Economics of Life Insurance An open text authored by the Actuarial Community Preface Date: 07 February 2022 Book Description Like the companion book Loss Data Analytics, this book on life contingencies will be an interactive, online, freely available text. The online version will contain many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning. A subset of the book will be available for offline reading in pdf and EPUB formats. Will focus on data and statistical aspects of life contingent events. Will emphasize cash flow fundamentals, an approach that allows users to easily adapt approaches to handle complex products. This modular approach emphasizing data and cash flow fundamentals has additional advantages: computational aspects become practically relevant through spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel) and numerical (R) examples, and an emphasis on the foundations provides an easy entry point for learners who wish an introduction to the field. How will the text be used? This book will be useful in actuarial curricula worldwide. Our primary target audience is second or third year undergraduates with little to no experience in insurance. Learners may be international; although the book will be in English, we do not expect knowledge of native idiosyncrasies that might be used in the classroom. It will cover the learning objectives of the major actuarial organizations. Thus, it will be suitable for classroom use at universities as well as for use by independent learners seeking to pass professional actuarial examinations. A secondary audience is the actuarial practitioner (perhaps international) who wishes to retool and learn about modern approaches in the risk management of life contingent events. Thus, the text will also be useful for the continuing professional development of actuaries and other professionals in insurance and related financial risk management industries. Why is this good for the profession? An online text is a type of open educational resource (OER). One important benefit of an OER is that it equalizes access to knowledge, thus permitting a broader community to learn about the actuarial profession. Moreover, it has the capacity to engage viewers through active learning that deepens the learning process, producing analysts more capable of solid actuarial work. Why is this good for students and teachers and others involved in the learning process? Cost is often cited as an important factor for students and teachers in textbook selection (see a recent post on the $400 textbook). Students will also appreciate the ability to carry the book around on their mobile devices. Life Contingent Calculations Life contingences is a quantitative discipline, enjoying the rigor and discipline of mathematics. Like any mathematical discipline, one traditionally learns about it through the development of formulaic expressions, that is, their proofs, special cases, analysis of special features, and so on. Users of this text find that we do not shy away from presenting summaries of main conclusions using formulaic expressions. Nonetheless, rather than developing insights from mathematical proofs of the primary findings, we demonstrate their impact through short illustrative examples and links to practical applications. As with other sources that introduce life contingencies, we utilize spreadsheets extensively. In our teaching, we find that spreadsheets are useful for communication and dynamically visualizing results as they evolve over time. However, unlike other sources, we supplement this with approaches that emphasize programming; in this text, we use R. Programming methods such as through R (and Python, another good candidate) easily accommodate more complex situations that require more computing and, moreover, are built to graphically portray results in an attractive fashion. Analytics, the process of using data to make decisions, is enjoying tremendous attention from many industries; this is certainly true of in data-driven fields that use life contingent methods. By working with data and using programming methods such as R in the study of life contingences, users see the connections within many fields that support the actuarial science discpline. Instruction may emphasize any one of the three approaches, traditional mathematical development, spreadsheets, or a computing approach. However, this text contains all three as we believe that future generations of actuaries need to be familiar with all of these different ways to analyze, and communicate, problems that can be solved using life contingent methods.

These models, in turn, have to be calibrated in the context of relevant (mortality) data. Therefore, in this chapter, we first present different types of data that describe the lifetimes and mortality of a certain population. We deliberately introduce the data in Section 2.1 without assuming prior knowledge of life contingent modeling, and aim to develop an intuitive understanding of some of the associated challenges. We then introduce the conventional framework for modeling lifetimes, particularly by introducing the concept of a future lifetime variable \\(T_{\\bf x}\\) and its properties, and we then explore various approaches of specifying and estimating its distribution. Here, we discuss the traditional actuarial models for lifetimes such as analytical mortality laws and life tables, but we also introduce conditional predictive models that characterize the lifetime distribution based on a set of covariates or features. 2.1 Mortality data: Life Expectancies, Deaths, Counts, &amp; Lifetimes 2.1.1 Life Expectancies Perhaps the most relevant question to any individual when it comes to their future lifetime is: how long am I expected to live? As we will discuss, there are many angles to this question. However, as a first and proximate answer, we may rely on public statistics. Government agencies around the world publish vital statistics such as the life expectancies for their population, which are typically separated by age and gender  and potentially other attributes such as race. The file CDCLifeExp.csv is provided with the supplemental information of this text and includes an excerpt of the U.S. national vital statistics that provides Expectation of life, by age, race, [] and sex: United States, 2017 in Table 2.1. library(knitr) us_les &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/CDCLifeExp.csv&quot;) kable(us_les, caption=&quot;Life Expectancies From 2017 U.S. National Vital Statistics&quot;) Table 2.1: Life Expectancies From 2017 U.S. National Vital Statistics Age Total Male Female Hispanic..Total Hispanic..Male Hispanic..Female 0 78.6 76.1 81.1 81.8 79.1 84.3 20 59.4 57.0 61.8 62.5 59.9 64.9 40 40.7 38.7 42.6 43.5 41.2 45.5 60 23.3 21.7 24.7 25.5 23.6 27.0 80 9.2 8.4 9.8 10.5 9.4 11.1 This excerpt provides the life expectancy for ages 0 (newborn), 20, 40, 60, and 80 observed within a population, for males and females with separate figures for the hispanic subpopulation. There are a few immediate observations. First, females generally seem to have a longer life expectancy than males, whereas the aggregate Total life expectancy is in between the two figures. This is intuitive as the aggregate population is (largely) made up of male and female individuals, so that the Total life expectancy is a weighted average of the gender-specific life expectancies, relative to the composition of the population. Second, life expectancy is decreasing in age, which again is intuitive: older individuals will have shorter life expectancies, ceteris paribus. It may be somewhat less obvious that the differences in life expectancies are less than the differences in age; subtracting the lines in Table 2.1 gives incremental life expectancies for 20-year age gaps. kable(us_les[1:4,2:7]-us_les[2:5,2:7]) Total Male Female Hispanic..Total Hispanic..Male Hispanic..Female 19.2 19.1 19.3 19.3 19.2 19.4 18.7 18.3 19.2 19.0 18.7 19.4 17.4 17.0 17.9 18.0 17.6 18.5 14.1 13.3 14.9 15.0 14.2 15.9 Hence, while a 40-year-old male is twenty years older than a 20-year-old male, the 20-year-olds life expectancy is 18.3 years higher. The difference of 1.7 years is due to the possibility of the 20-year-old not surviving up to age 40. Consider the following: 40-year-old males lived 20 years since age 20 plus they are expected to live another 38.7 years, for a total of 58.7 years; in contrast, 20-year-old males have a life expectancy of 57 years, which is 1.7 years less. In other words, 40-year-old males have a higher expected age at death than 20-year-old males, because view view them conditionally on already having lived until age 40. As the table reveals, this effect is more pronounced when comparing a 40-year-old with a 60-year-old or a 60-year-old with an 80-year-old. Third, the life expectancies for the hispanic subpopulation exceed the figures of the total population, which suggests that other subpopulations must exhibit a lower life expectancy. There are many questions of potential reasons for this difference, although these fall more in the demographic or even sociological realm. For insstance, there are many interesting studies related to the dependence of life expectancies on socio-economic factors, including some concerning recent trends related to so-called deaths of despair in the U.S. From an actuarial perspective, a relevant question may be how we could model the mortality data. In other words, is there a simple parametric model that may describe the progression of life expectancy across ages, at least in the context of one particular population? We will return to this question in the context of our mortality models, particularly in Section 2.3. As an early caveat to the question raised at the beginning of this section, it is not necessarily accurate to take these figures as estimates of a given individuals future lifetime or even its expectation. This is the case since the life expectancy is usually generated based on recent mortality experience rather than forecasts. As we will discuss in Section 2.4, this is the difference between the so-called period and cohort life expectancies. 2.1.2 Population Mortality Counts We now bring into consideration mortality experience for populations that had been observed over time, which is available at the Human Mortality Database (HMD) for a wide range of countries. The available data include Exposures by age, sex, and calender year period, i.e. how many people people of a given age and sex lived in the countrys population during a given period of time, and corresponding Deaths, i.e. how many of these individuals had died. In the supplemental information to this text, we provide exposures and deaths for the U.S. population, downloaded from the HMD as HMD_Expo.csv and HMD_Deaths.csv. We use the data over five year intervals starting at 1935 until 2015. Let us take a look at the exposures: us_exp &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/HMD_Expo.csv&quot;) kable(head(us_exp), align = &quot;cccrrr&quot;, digits = 2, format.args = list(big.mark = &quot;,&quot;)) Year_start Year_end Age Female Male Total 1935 1939 0 4,869,267 5,057,569 9,926,836 1935 1939 1 4,802,597 4,936,238 9,738,835 1935 1939 2 5,119,574 5,244,634 10,364,208 1935 1939 3 5,159,494 5,287,402 10,446,896 1935 1939 4 5,189,350 5,307,754 10,497,104 1935 1939 5 5,359,159 5,531,967 10,891,126 and deaths: us_deaths &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/HMD_Deaths.csv&quot;) kable(head(us_deaths), align = &quot;cccrrr&quot;, digits = 2, format.args = list(big.mark = &quot;,&quot;)) Year_start Year_end Age Female Male Total 1935 1939 0 253,145.89 335,492.00 588,637.89 1935 1939 1 36,010.02 42,169.20 78,179.22 1935 1939 2 17,718.83 21,208.22 38,927.05 1935 1939 3 12,450.36 14,852.17 27,302.53 1935 1939 4 10,154.85 11,771.25 21,926.10 1935 1939 5 8,678.43 10,339.57 19,018.00 To illustrate, let us plot the exposures and deaths for a 70-year-old U.S. females over time, which is given in Figure 2.1: R Code For Figure options(digits = 9) options(scipen = 9) par(mfrow=c(1,2)) plot(us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,2], us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,4]/1000, type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 5, col = &quot;green&quot;, main=&quot;Exposures&quot;, xlab = &quot;year&quot;, ylab = &quot;count&quot;, ylim = c(0,max(us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,4])/1000)) plot(us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,2], us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,4]/1000, type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 5, col = &quot;red&quot;, main=&quot;Deaths&quot;, xlab = &quot;year&quot;, ylab = &quot;count&quot;, ylim = c(0,max(us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,4])/1000)) Figure 2.1: Exposures and Deaths (in thousands) for Females age 70 from the HMD U.S. The stark increase in exposures is due to two effects; on one hand, the U.S. population had been growing substantially since 1935, and on the other hand, individuals had been showing an enhanced life expectancy over time. As a consequence, the number of 70-year-old U.S. females had increased from less than two million to more than six million. In contrast, the number of deaths had been more steady. While with an increasing number of exposures the number of deaths have increased, the chance of dying for a 70-year-old had been decreasing. The latter becomes more evident by plotting the ratio of deaths and exposures as in Figure 2.2 R Code For Figure par(mfrow=c(1,1)) minlim &lt;- min(us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,4]/us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,4]) maxlim &lt;- max(us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,4]/us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,4]) plot(us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,2],us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,4]/us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,4],type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 5, col = &quot;blue&quot;, main=&quot;Deaths/Exposures&quot;, xlab = &quot;year&quot;, ylab = &quot;rate&quot;,ylim = c(minlim,maxlim)) rm(minlim, maxlim) Figure 2.2: Death rates for Females age 70 from the HMD U.S Note that the chance of dying for a 70-year-old female was more than 4% around 1940, but it had decreased over time to a level lower than 2%. As we will see in Section 2.4, the ratio of deaths and exposures is closely related to death rates. Alternatively, we can focus on a specific period  say the most recent five years in our data, i.e. 2010-2014  and plot the deaths over exposures across ages as in Figure 2.3 R Code For Figure us_mx_fem_2014 &lt;- us_deaths[us_deaths$Year_start == 2010,4]/us_exp[us_exp$Year_start == 2010,4] us_mx_mal_2014 &lt;- us_deaths[us_deaths$Year_start == 2010,5]/us_exp[us_exp$Year_start == 2010,5] plot(us_mx_fem_2014,type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 5, col = &quot;blue&quot;, main=&quot;Deaths/Exposures&quot;, xlab = &quot;year&quot;, ylab = &quot;death rate&quot;, ylim = c(min(us_mx_fem_2014),max(us_mx_fem_2014))) Figure 2.3: Death rates for Females across ages for 2010-2014 from the HMD U.S. We observe that the death rate increases fairly regularly with respect to age and its growth looks exponential. This observation is the foundation for the most famous and common analytic mortality model that is detailed in Section 2.3 known as the Gompertz law. It should be noted that the death rates at higher ages, specifically from 106 to 110, are showing a larger variability that could be explained by the fact very small sub-populations of high ages are observed and the estimates are more uncertain than those at lower ages. We note some precaution when using the Human Mortality Database (HMD). It is intended to provide a wide range of interested parties with detailed and up-to-date mortality and population data covering about 41 countries. There are some countries that may exhibit different mortality patterns from these 41 countries, and these include for example, some of the most populous countries such as China, India, and Indonesia, and several countries in the African continents such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Egypt. 2.1.3 Individual Mortality Data While mortality counts are a common way to organize mortality data across a large population, which had been our emphasis in the previous section, the individual survival time data may provide valuable pieces of information. Indeed, the data available to an insurance company typically consists of records of individuals. The company records individual details for each insured person from when they purchased the contract; these include personal characteristics such as sex, age, date-of-birth, etc., but also medical records and other underwriting information. In addition, the company knows whether or not the person had died at the current timeand if so, the time of death. This latter aspect is common for survival or event history data. For each observation (individual) \\(i\\), a number of covariates or features \\(\\textbf{x}_i\\), as well as the event time \\(T_i\\) if the event has already happened. Otherwise, we only know that by the current cutoff time, the event has not happened yet. In the context of survival analysis, which is the branch of statistics that deals with survival or event data, this is known as (right) censoring, i.e. the data are (right-)censored. Data protection policies are omnipresent and insurance companies are not any different with respect to policyholder data. On one hand, there are regulatory data protection that disallow disclosure of personal identifiable pieces of information. On the other hand, data are a key resource to a life insurer and sharing this valuable piece of information creates a competition disadvantage by revealing important information to the companys competitive position. Therefore, rather than relying on real survival data, we consider a synthetic dataset consisting of a hypothetical portfolio of policyholders. In the supplemental information to this text, we provide survival information for a hypothetical insurance company in SyntheticInsurerData.csv. The company has sold whole life insurance policies for since 1955 (the coming chapters discuss different life insurance policies in detail). Policyholders have to go through an underwriting examination, and in addition to policyholders age, sex (0 for female, 1 for male), smoking status (0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker), and the month of sale, the company records the applicants body-mass index (BMI) and the systolic blood pressure at the time of underwriting. Finally, for those policyholders with a claim, i.e., for the policyholders that have died, the company records the time of death (relative to the month of underwriting). The data is organized in the order of sales, so that the oldest entries are at the top of the data and the newest entries are at the bottom: library(data.table) ins_data &lt;- fread(&quot;Data/SyntheticInsurerData.csv&quot;,data.table=FALSE) kable(head(ins_data), align = &quot;ccccrrrr&quot;,digits = 2) #displaying the very end of the table similar to the very top of the table requires a few more steps tmp_tail_ins_data &lt;- tail(ins_data); rownames(tmp_tail_ins_data) &lt;- NULL kable(tmp_tail_ins_data, align = &quot;ccccrrrr&quot;,digits = 2) Month_of_Sale Age Sex Smoking BMI BloodPressure Claim Time_of_death 1 27 0 0 25.8 117 YES 55.63 1 51 1 0 17.6 109 YES 18.53 1 59 1 0 22.5 132 YES 15.88 1 37 1 0 22.9 109 YES 57.40 1 62 0 0 30.9 147 YES 27.83 1 31 0 0 17.3 91 YES 64.06 Month_of_Sale Age Sex Smoking BMI BloodPressure Claim Time_of_death 780 43 0 0 17.10 110 NO NA 780 57 1 1 19.30 118 NO NA 780 40 0 0 20.10 117 NO NA 780 27 1 0 20.60 90 NO NA 780 55 1 1 20.10 118 NO NA 780 23 1 0 19.03 82 NO NA Evidently, most of the policies sold in the first monthsback in 1955have matured, and most recently underwritten policyholders are still alive. Let us further investigate the mortality dataframe and we start by summarizing the attributes of our data: suppressWarnings(library(psych)) tmp_describe_ins_data&lt;-psych::describe(ins_data) kable(tmp_describe_ins_data, digits = 2, format.args = list(big.mark = &quot;,&quot;)) vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis se Month_of_Sale 1 160,781 394.58 216.72 382.00 393.08 277.25 1.0 780.0 779.0 0.08 -1.17 0.54 Age 2 160,781 39.99 11.61 39.00 39.65 11.86 19.0 65.0 46.0 0.22 -0.73 0.03 Sex 3 160,781 0.70 0.46 1.00 0.75 0.00 0.0 1.0 1.0 -0.87 -1.25 0.00 Smoking 4 160,781 0.30 0.46 0.00 0.25 0.00 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.88 -1.22 0.00 BMI 5 160,781 22.79 4.55 21.70 22.20 3.85 16.1 69.6 53.5 1.46 3.26 0.01 BloodPressure 6 160,781 114.74 15.75 114.00 114.36 16.31 57.0 208.0 151.0 0.26 0.09 0.04 Claim* 7 160,781 1.37 0.48 1.00 1.34 0.00 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.54 -1.71 0.00 Time_of_death 8 59,382 28.27 13.69 28.36 28.24 15.21 0.0 64.2 64.2 0.02 -0.73 0.06 In summary, there are 160,781 insureds, out of which 59,382, i.e. 36.93%, have died; the average age at purchase is about 40, and our portfolio has a high percentage of men (70%) and non-smokers (70%). The average BMI is 22.8 and the average blood pressure is 114.7, which are close to (but somewhat lower than) U.S. national averages; for details on common BMI and blood pressure levels, see e.g. the Withings Health Observatory that provides real-time information for U.S. Americans. To illustrate the sales history, we plot the monthly sales of the company, which is given as Figure 2.4. R Code For Figure monthly_sales &lt;- rep(0,780) for (i in 1:780){ monthly_sales[i] &lt;- sum(ins_data$Month_of_Sale == i) } plot(monthly_sales,type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 2, col = &quot;green&quot;, main=&quot;Monthly Sales&quot;, xlab = &quot;month&quot;, ylab = &quot;Sales&quot;) abline(h = mean(monthly_sales), col = &quot;red&quot;, lty = 2) Figure 2.4: Monthy sales for the synthetic mortality data In summary, the company sells about 200 insurance contracts each month, although there is some variation over time; while sales initially increased, the company experience some ebbs and flows, potentially due to marketing efforts and/or the effectiveness or attractiveness of the products. We now investigate the traits of the insureds for which various histograms are given as Figure 2.5. R Code For Figure par(mfrow=c(1,3)) hist(ins_data$Age,main=&quot;Insured Age&quot;, xlab=&quot;age&quot;, border=&quot;red&quot;, col=&quot;green&quot;) hist(ins_data$BMI,main=&quot;Body Mass Index&quot;, xlab=&quot;bmi&quot;, border=&quot;red&quot;, col=&quot;green&quot;) hist(ins_data$BloodPressure,main=&quot;Systolic Blood Pressure&quot;, xlab=&quot;bp&quot;, border=&quot;red&quot;, col=&quot;green&quot;) Figure 2.5: Histograms for the synthetic mortality data Most individuals are in between thirty and fifty years of age when purchasing the coverage, but some sales to younger and some older individuals are observed. The Body Mass Index (BMI) is concentrated between 20 and 30, although there are some outliers with relatively large values. The systolic blood pressure is roughly bell shaped, with most applicants exhibiting blood pressure measurements at normal levels (below 120) or slightly elevated levels (120-130). We further visualize the relationship between these three attributes by looking at the correlation correlation matrix corresponding to these three characteristics, which is given as Figure 2.6. R Code For Figure suppressWarnings(library(corrplot)) tmp_corr_ins_data &lt;- cor(ins_data[,c(2,5,6)]) colnames(tmp_corr_ins_data) &lt;- c(&quot;Age&quot;, &quot;BMI&quot;, &quot;BP&quot;) rownames(tmp_corr_ins_data) &lt;- c(&quot;Age&quot;, &quot;BMI&quot;, &quot;BP&quot;) corrplot(tmp_corr_ins_data, method=&quot;circle&quot;, order=&quot;hclust&quot;, addCoef.col = &quot;red&quot;, tl.col=&quot;black&quot;,tl.srt=45) Figure 2.6: Correlation matrix for the synthetic mortality data corresponding to age, BMI and BP (blood pressure) Clearly, high blood pressure and elevated BMI are positively associated, and an elevated blood pressure is more common for elderly insureds, which are common observations in many populations. One of our main focus is the realized lifetime, which can only be observed for those individuals where a claim had been paid. We thus plot the distribution of the age at death based on these observations, which is illustrated in Figure 2.7. hist(ins_data$Age+ins_data$Time_of_death,main=&quot;Age at Death&quot;, xlab=&quot;age&quot;, border=&quot;red&quot;, col=&quot;green&quot;) Figure 2.7: Age at Death for the synthetic mortality data Not surprisingly, the majority of deceased policyholders have died at higher ages, since the bulk of deaths are concentrated between seventy and ninety years old. There are a few individuals that died relatively young, and similarly a few that were close to achieving the centenarian status, though it should be noted that some policyholders at higher ages may still be alive. Indeed, the ages of five oldest individuals that are still alive are round(tail(sort(ins_data[ins_data$Claim == &quot;NO&quot;,2]+ (780 - ins_data[ins_data$Claim == &quot;NO&quot;,1])/12),5), digits = 2) [1] 102.50 102.67 103.50 104.17 105.58 and thus, it is clear that we observe not many centenarians. It is intuitive that the number of deaths are associated with sales: The maximal number of deaths is the number of individuals that purchased insurance. This is evident when plotting the number of deaths by the year of sale, which is displayed in Figure 2.8, particularly over the early years. R Code For Figure annual_death &lt;- rep(0,65) for (i in 1:65){ for (j in 1:12){ annual_death[i] &lt;- annual_death[i] + sum(ins_data[ins_data$Month_of_Sale == (i-1)*12 +j,7] == &quot;YES&quot;) } } plot(annual_death,type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 4, col = &quot;blue&quot;, main=&quot;Annual Deaths&quot;, xlab = &quot;Year&quot;, ylab = &quot;Deaths&quot;) Figure 2.8: Annual deaths for the synthetic mortality data We can also investigate the relationship of the time of death to policyholder characteristics by creating a correlation plot amongst those that had already died.

Similar behaviour is also observed for the BMI and blood pressure attributes that are negatively associated with the the time of death, but we should clarify that the BMI and blood pressure measurements are observed at policy inception though these negative associations explain why such attributes are good predictors of the insureds health. The pairwise correlation between age, BMI and blood pressure are in line with our findings from Figure 2.6 that includes all insureds irrespective of their life status. Even this simple analysis helps in understanding why the life office should evaluate the individual risk per policy by taking into consideration the available information, and more importantly, to have a fair evaluation of the covariates with strong influence over the policy final payout. Returning to our general description of survival data sets in the current context, if there was a claim and the death event was recorded, this data entry is non-censored; however, if the claim is not raised, then the policyholder is alive by the end of the observation period, and in turn, this datum is right-censored as the death event has not yet occurred. For example, a policyholder of age \\(33\\) buys a policy in early January 1990, i.e. her/his Month_of_Sale record would be \\(421\\)  recall that month \\(780\\) indicates that a policy is bought in December 2019. If the policyholder survives by the end of the observation period, then a censored datum is recorded as \\(30\\); in contrast, if the policyholder dies 13 years and 2 months after, then a censored datum is recorded with an event time \\(13+2/12\\approx13.17\\). 2.2 Modeling Death The previous section has introduced various examples of mortality data. Clearly, the most relevant question to actuaries is how to use the available pieces of information in order to devise lifetime models that could become the basis for analyzing the life contingent exposures. This section provides the theoretical foundation for modeling lifetimes. An important caveat is that we focus, both in the presentation of the datasets and in the modeling considerations in this chapter, on understanding the lifetime uncertainty for a given individual or (sub)population, where the life status is assumed to be dichotomous, i.e. alive and dead are the only life status under observation. Clearly, this simplified assumption helps us to create a parsimonious presentation that is fit for its purpose at this very moment, though one could consider multi-state models  with multiple life status such as alive, death, temporary disability, permanent disability and any other long term health condition, etc.  or models with multiple decrements that relate to specific life insurance products where the modeler could consider non-health related factors such as early termination of a contract that have an impact on the policys cashflows. Clearly multi-state and multi-decrement models present a generalization of the dichotomous lifetime model, where there are only two states  alive and dead  and a single decrement  dying, respectively. However, aside from being an important special case, there are benefits to discussing and building such more general models armed with the understanding of and experience working with the dichotomous model. We will return to multi-decrement and multi-state models in Chapter XX. We commence by introducing the most important concept of a lifetime random variable and then discuss key actuarial quantities that allow for a formal interpretation of the data previously presented. We deviate from a traditional actuarial presentation in that we allow for general attributes, which we denote by \\(\\bf{x}\\), to affect the lifetime distribution. However, towards the end of the section, we specialize to the more limited  but in traditional actuarial modeling conventional  assumption that the only relevant (dynamic) covariate for the distribution of the lifetimes is age \\(x\\). 2.2.1 Lifetime Random Variable and its Distribution We start by considering an individual with attributes \\(\\bf{x}\\) from some feature space. We assume that the attributes \\(\\bf{x}\\) are sufficient to determine the distribution of the individuals future lifetime, which we denote by \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\). In other words, the lifetime random variable \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\) follows a distribution depending on the attributes \\(\\bf{x}\\). We will assume this random variable has positive real values, i.e. its support is \\((0,\\infty)\\), and that the random variable is well-behaved (integrable, continuous, etc.) so that all the operations in what follows are well-defined. It is helpful to pause and reflect on different types of possible attributes. Some attributes, such as the individuals race, the individuals (biological) sex, race, learned profession, etc., are immutable. Thus, one can either include them in the considered set of attributes \\(\\bf{x}\\). Or we can consider a population of individuals with the same immutable characteristics, and then differentiate them solely by non-immutable characteristics \\(\\bf{x}\\). An example are the life expectancy tables in Section 2.1.1: here the relevant population could be hispanic females, for which we distinguished (only) different age levels. This approach, where age  typically denoted by \\(x\\)  is the only attribute under consideration, is the setting contemplated in traditional life-contingent analysis, and we will discuss this as an important special case in the last part 2.2.3 of this section. However, the latter setting is restrictive from a number of perspectives. For instance, there are various individual characteristics that are relevant to the future lifetime that are non-immutable. For instance, the health-related attributes of BMI and systolic blood pressure in the dataset presented in Section 2.1.3 may change over time, and a blood pressure level of 130 for a 30 year old may carry a different interpretation than a level of 130 for a 70 year old. Moreover, environmental or socio-economic conditions may change over time and could impact the distribution of future lifetimes, and these could also be reflected in the set of attributes \\(\\bf{x}\\). We leave the exploration of different relevant examples to the remaining sections of this chapter as well as later, more advanced chapters of this book. Let \\(F_{\\bf{x}}\\) and \\(S_{\\bf{x}}\\) be the cumulative distribution function (cdf) and survival function of \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\), respectively: \\[ F_{\\bf{x}}(t) =\\Pr(T_{\\bf{x}}\\le t)\\quad \\text{and}\\quad S_{\\bf{x}}(t) =\\Pr(T_{\\bf{x}} &gt; t)=1-\\Pr(T_{\\bf{x}} \\le t)=1-F_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\quad\\text{for all}\\;t\\geq0. \\] Given our natural assumption that the lifetime variable \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\) is continuously distributed, i.e. that there are no outcomes that carry point masses, we can also defined its probability density function \\(f_{\\bf{x}}\\): \\[ f_{\\bf{x}}(t) =\\frac{\\partial F_{\\bf{x}}(t)}{\\partial t}=\\frac{\\partial \\big(1- S_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\big)}{\\partial t}=-\\frac{\\partial S_{\\bf{x}}(t)}{\\partial t},\\;t\\geq 0. \\] Similarly, we can define the force of mortality, \\(\\mu_\\bf{x}\\), which in different contexts is also referred to as the hazard rate or the mortality intensity: \\[ \\mu_{\\bf{x}}(t) = - \\frac{\\partial \\log\\{ S_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{-\\frac{\\partial S_{\\bf{x}}(t)}{\\partial t}}{S_{\\bf{x}}(t)}=\\frac{f_{\\bf{x}}(t)}{S_{\\bf{x}}(t)},\\;t\\geq 0, \\] which is equivalent to: \\[ S_{\\bf{x}}(t) = \\exp\\left\\{-\\int_0^t \\mu_{\\bf{x}}(s)\\;ds \\right\\}\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad t\\ge 0. \\] The important point to note is that any one of the functions \\(F_{\\bf{x}}\\), \\(S_{\\bf{x}}\\), \\(f_{\\bf{x}}\\), or \\(\\mu_{\\bf{x}}\\) completely determines the distribution of the future lifetime \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\). In other words, in order to specify a probabilistic model of future lifetimes, we can choose to model any of these quantities  knowing the form of just one of them will allow you to determine expressions for the other functions. 2.2.2 Standard Actuarial Notation: \\(q_{\\bf{x}}\\), \\(_tp_{\\bf{x}}\\), and All That The introduction of the lifetime random variable, in principle, is enough for actuarial analyses of life-contingent exposures. In particular, as we will see in the next chapter, based on \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\) we can model (discounted) cash flows of common life insurance and annuity products, determine their expected values and variances, etc. However, the discussion so far was primarily formal and did not instill much intuition. For instance, the cdf \\(F_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\) at time \\(t\\) is nothing else than the probability that an individual will die before a certain time \\(t\\), i.e. the mortality probability; and the expected value of \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\) is nothing else than the expected years lived, i.e. the life expectancy, for an individual with attributes \\(\\bf{x}\\) that we had already encountered in Section 2.1.1 in the context of national vital statistics. To instill interpretation into the notation, but also to have a precise, uniform representation to record and communicate relevant quantities, actuaries around the globe rely on so-called standard actuarial notation. This notation is based on a so-called Halo system where symbols are placed as superscript or subscript before or after a main character. In particular, the \\(t\\)-year mortality probability for an individual with attributes \\(\\bf{x}\\) is denotes by \\(_tq_{\\bf{x}}\\): \\[ {_tq_{\\bf{x}}} = F_{\\bf{x}}(t),\\;t\\geq 0. \\] Similarly the \\(t\\)-year survival probability, denoted by \\(_tp_{\\bf{x}}\\), is nothing else than the survival function: \\[ {_tp_{\\bf{x}}} = S_{\\bf{x}}(t),\\;t\\geq 0. \\] Clearly, \\({_tp_{\\bf{x}}}+{_tq_{\\bf{x}}}=1\\), since the individual \\(x\\) either dies or survives after \\(t\\) units of time. Furthermore, is is conventional to drop a superscript of one: \\[ {_1p_{\\bf{x}}} = {p_{\\bf{x}}}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad {_1q_{\\bf{x}}} = {q_{\\bf{x}}}. \\] Furthemore, we denote the \\(s\\)-year mortality probability after surviving for \\(t\\) years as: \\[ {_{t|s}q_{\\bf{x}}} = F_{\\bf{x}}(t+s) - F_{\\bf{x}}(t) = {_{t+s}q_{\\bf{x}}} - {_tq_{\\bf{x}}} = S_{\\bf{x}}(t) - S_{\\bf{x}}(t+s) = {_tp_{\\bf{x}}} - {_{t+s}p_{\\bf{x}}} ,\\;t,s\\geq 0. \\] As indicated, the expected value of the lifetime random variable corresponds to the (complete) expectation of life or life expectancy. It is defined as follows: \\[ \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{\\bf{x}}=E[T_{\\bf{x}}]=\\int_0^\\infty t \\,f_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\;dt=\\int_0^\\infty {_tp_{\\bf{x}}}\\;dt, \\] where the last equaility follows from integration by parts. Derivation of Formula for Complete Life Expectancy \\[ \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{\\bf{x}} = E[T_{\\bf{x}}] = \\int_0^{\\infty} t\\, \\underbrace{f_{\\bf{x}}(t)}_{-S_{\\bf{x}}&#39;(t)}\\,dt = - \\left[S_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\, t\\right]_{t=0}^{\\infty} + \\int_0^{\\infty} S_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\,dt = \\int_0^{\\infty} {_tp_{\\bf{x}}}\\,dt. \\] It is also helpful to define a temporary version of the expectation of life, i.e. the number of years lived wihin the next \\(n\\) years. In actuarial notation, temporary quantities are denoted by \\(\\cdot_{\\cdot:\\overline{n}|}\\): \\[ \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{{\\bf{x}}:\\overline{n}|} = E[\\min\\{T_{\\bf{x}},n\\}] = \\int_0^{n} {_tp_{\\bf{x}}}\\,dt. \\] The interpretation is that unlike for the complete expectation of life, we only count years lived until time \\(n.\\) For instance, considering a population of \\(l_0\\) individuals, while \\(l_0 \\times {_tp_{\\bf{x}}}\\) denotes the expected number of survivors until time \\(t\\), \\(l_0 \\times \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{{\\bf{x}}:\\overline{t}|}\\) denotes the average size of the population over the next \\(t\\) periods. We will return to this point in the context of life tables in section 2.4. We will see many more examples of actuarial notation through the course of this book, and we will heavily rely on it. 2.2.3 The Classical Case: Age-Only Model As mentioned, an important special case is the situation where the only (non-immutable) attribute is age. In this case, it is conventional to write \\({\\bf{x}} = x\\), where \\(x\\) is a number denoting current age, and the lifetime random variable \\(T_x\\) that explains the remaining future lifetime for an individual currently aged \\(x\\). Hence, in this case, \\(T_x\\)  and its distribution  solely depends on the age \\(x\\), and, thus, \\(T_x\\) and \\(T_0|T_0&gt;x\\) are identically distributed random variables (here \\(T_0|T_0&gt;x\\) denotes the random variable conditional on the event \\(\\{T_0&gt;x\\}\\)). In other words, the future lifetime for \\((x)\\) is the same as the future lifetime of a newborn given that this newborn reaches age \\(x\\), \\(T_0&gt;x\\). The mathematical formulations are thus described by conditional probabilities: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} {_tq_x} = F_x(t) &amp;=&amp; Pr(T_x \\le t) = Pr(T_x \\le t \\mid T_x&gt;0) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; Pr(T_0-x \\le t \\mid T_0-x&gt;0) = Pr(T_0 \\le x + t \\mid T_0 &gt; x)\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{\\Pr(x&lt;T_0\\leq x+t)}{\\Pr(T_0&gt;x)}=\\frac{F_0(x+t)-F_0(x)}{S_0(x)}=\\frac{S_0(x)-S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] and \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} {_tp_x} = S_x(t) &amp;=&amp; Pr(T_x &gt; t) = Pr(T_x &gt; t \\mid T_x &gt; 0) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; Pr(T_0-x &gt; t \\mid T_0-x&gt;0) = Pr(T_0 &gt; x+t \\mid T_0&gt;x)\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{\\Pr(T_0&gt; x+t)}{\\Pr(T_0&gt;x)}=\\frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Similarly, the probability density function of \\(T_x\\) is simply given by the conditional density function of \\(T_0\\): \\[ f_x(t)=-\\frac{\\partial S_x(t)}{\\partial t}=-\\frac{\\partial \\left(\\frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}\\right)}{\\partial t}=-\\frac{\\frac{\\partial S_0(x+t)}{\\partial t}}{S_0(x)}=\\frac{f_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}\\quad\\text{for all}\\;t&gt;0. \\] and the force of mortality: \\[ \\mu_x(t) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\log\\{S_x(t)\\} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\log\\{S_0(x+t)\\} = \\mu_0(x+t) = \\mu_{x+t}, \\] i.e. it depends on current age only. Given the formula for the survival probability, we have: \\[ {_tp_x} = \\frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)} = \\frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x+s)} \\frac{S_0(x+s)}{S_0(x)} = \\frac{S_0(x+s + (t-s))}{S_0(x+s)} \\frac{S_0(x+s)}{S_0(x)} = {_{t-s}p_{x+s}}\\,{_sp_x}, \\] i.e. survival probabilities factorize into subperiod survival probabilities in this case. This is one of the key properties that does not hold in the general situation for \\({_tp_{\\bf{x}}}\\) from the previous section, but simplifies expressions in this age-only model. For instance, we obtain for the \\(s\\)-year mortality probability after surviving for \\(t\\) years as: \\[ {_{t|s}q_{x}} = {_tp_x} - {_{t+s}p_x} = {_tp_x}\\, (1 - {_sp_{x+t}}) = {_tp_x}\\,{_sq_{x+t}},\\;t,s\\geq 0. \\] As for another example, we can express the \\(n\\)-year temporary life expectancy for an \\(x\\)-year old as a function of complete life expectancies at ages \\(x\\) and \\(x+n\\), and the survival probability: \\[ \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x:\\overline{n}|} = \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x}-{_np_x}\\,\\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x+n}. \\] Derivation of Relationship for Temporary Life Expectancy \\[ \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x:\\overline{n}|} = \\int_0^{n} {_tp_x}\\,dt = \\int_0^{\\infty} {_tp_x}\\,dt - \\int_n^{\\infty} {_tp_x}\\,dt = \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x} - {_np_x}\\,\\int_n^{\\infty} {_{t-n}p_{x+n}}\\,dt = \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x} - {_np_x}\\,\\int_0^{\\infty} {_{t}p_{x+n}}\\,dt = \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x}-{_np_x}\\,\\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x+n}. \\] Some of the most common models for future lifetimes fall in this category of age-only models, in particular the most common analytical mortality laws that we will encounter in the next section as well as models based on conventional life tables (see Section 2.4)  both of which are very common in actuarial analysis. While the idea of age being the sole co-variate appears limiting, recall the note from above that one could view the model as specific to a certain population with the same immutable characteristics. Indeed, sometimes it is helpful to carry immutable characteristics as an additional subscript, say \\({\\bf{x}}=(x,a)\\) where \\(a\\) is immutable. Here, the same considerations apply as in the age-only model, e.g. we have: \\[ {_tp_{(x,a)}} = {_{t-s}p_{(x+s,a)}}\\,{_sp_{(x,a)}}, \\] We will encounter similar models and notation in the context of select-and-ultimate life tables or in the context of cohort life tables in Section 2.4. That said, approaches that allow for individual attributes affecting the future lifetime distribution as survival regression models that we will discuss in Section 2.6 as well as models that incorporate a stochastic evolution of mortality rates due to uncertainty in the demographic environment or in medical technology do not fall in this class of age-only models, but are covered by our more general approach and notation. Obviously, in order to make the model accurate, it should include all possible sources of data and their attributes that could better differentiate the mortality risk amongst insureds or in other words, to achieve equity in the pricing process. However, the choice of an appropriate model also depends on context and potential restrictions. For example, the use of genetic specific attributes for risk classification is under vast scrutiny by insurance ethical experts, since such pieces of information could lead to genetic discrimination, and therefore, there are regulatory constraints in using such attributes. Moreover, even the (biological) sex attribute  one of the most important mortality explanatory variable  is not always acceptable; for example, the European Union insurance regulations had imposed pricing neutrality with respect to sex factors for quite some time, which means that life and non-life insurance policies issued within the European Union market should price males and females at the same level if all other observable attributes are similar. We will return to such considerations in future chapters when contemplating instututional aspects of certain insurance products or services. In the remainder of this chapter, we will discuss the most common mortality models, i.e. ways of characterizing the distribution of \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\). In particular, in addition to its specification, we will also comment on statistical estimation of the resulting model. 2.3 Analytical laws of mortality Actuarial practice relies on extensive mortality experience based on non-parametric and semi-parametric models. Early on mortality modeling had focused on simplified parametric models that depend on some parameters and are known as Analytic Mortality Laws; such models assume analytic survival or mortality functions, which have their own merits though the lack of sophistication is easily visible. From the pedagogical perspective, some of these analytical laws of mortality may be good toy models that provide simple approximations of reality, which is the essence of any model. These models are typically relatively simple and fall in the category of age-only models from Section 2.2.3, so that a suitable interpretatuion is that the model describes the mortality of a specific population. 2.3.1 De Moivre and Constant Force Models Starting with the simplest approach, it is clear that any survival function takes the value 1 and 0 at the left and right end point of its distribution. Thus, if a newborn is assumed to have a known limited age \\(\\omega\\), then \\(S_0(0)=1\\) and \\(S_0(\\omega)=0\\). One simple analytical example is the De Moivre Mortality Law which assumes a linear dependence of \\(S_0\\), i.e. \\[ S_0(x) = 1 - \\frac{x}{\\omega}\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad 0 \\leq x \\leq \\omega. \\] Now, the force of mortality becomes \\[ \\mu_x= \\frac{-S_0&#39;(x)}{S_0(x)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\omega}}{1 - \\frac{x}{\\omega}} = \\frac{1}{\\omega - x}\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad 0 \\leq x &lt; \\omega. \\] It should be noted that if the lifetime distribution of a newborn follows De Moivre Mortality Law, then once the newborn reaches a certain age \\(x\\), the new lifetime distribution also follows De Moivre, with a parameterization replacing \\(\\omega\\) with \\(\\omega -x\\). A generalization of the above analytical mortality law is known as the generalized De Moivre Law, and corresponds to a survival function with the following parametrization \\[ S_0(x) = \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{\\omega}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad 0\\leq x \\leq \\omega, \\] where the positive shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) decides how far the survival function departs from the linear dependence. Then, its force of mortality becomes \\[ \\mu_x = \\frac{\\alpha/\\omega\\,(1-x/\\omega)^{\\alpha-1}}{(1-x/\\omega)^{\\alpha}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\omega - x}\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad 0\\leq x \\leq \\omega. \\] Future lifetime distribution is also preserved with generalized De Moivre Law. For a newborn with mortality that follows this law, the future lifetime distribution, upon reaching a particular age \\(x\\), also follows generalized De Moivre Law. The \\(\\alpha\\) parameter is preserved but as in De Moivre Mortality Law, parameter \\(\\omega\\) is replaced with \\(\\omega -x\\). As indicated, a different approach is to impose a particular structure to the force of mortality. The simplest example is to consider a constant force of mortality model, i.e. \\(\\mu_t=\\mu\\) for all \\(t&gt;0\\), which corresponds to an Exponentially distributed lifetime \\(T_x\\) with \\[ S_0(x) = e^{-\\mu\\,x}\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad x\\ge 0. \\] Note that this constant force mortality model does not square with the idea the mortality is increasing over time, which makes it a poor candidate for modeling human mortality  although it may be a suitable candidate of modeling the death of certain populations or failure of non-organisms. For the De Moivre and generalized De Moivre mortality laws, we do observe an increasing force of mortality, although the hyperbolic relationship also does not match typical patterns of human mortality. 2.3.2 Gompertz and Makeham Laws In contrast, a candidate that is able to better depict human mortality is provided by the Gompertz Mortality Law and is given as follows: \\[ \\mu_x = B\\cdot c^x \\quad\\text{for all}\\quad x\\ge 0\\quad\\text{with}\\quad B&gt;0,\\,c&gt;1. \\] Its survival function becomes \\[ S_0(x) =\\exp\\left\\{-\\int_0^x \\mu_t\\;dt \\right\\}=\\exp\\left\\{-\\int_0^x B\\cdot c^t\\;dt \\right\\}=\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{B \\cdot c^t}{\\log c}\\Big\\lvert_{t=0}^{t=x} \\right\\} =\\exp\\left\\{ - \\frac{B}{\\log(c)} (c^x - 1)\\right\\}\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad x\\ge 0. \\] A three parameter version of the Gompertz Mortality Law was proposed by Makeham, where an age-independent term is added and captures the external causes of death, i.e. \\[ \\mu_x = A + B\\cdot c^x\\quad\\text{for all}\\quad x\\ge 0\\quad\\text{with}\\quad B&gt;0,\\,A+B\\geq 0,\\,c&gt;1, \\] and is known as the Gompertz-Makeham Mortality Law or Makeham Mortality Law. Then, its survival function could be derived as follows: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} S_0(x) &amp;=&amp; \\exp\\left\\{-\\int_0^x \\mu_t\\,dt\\right\\}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\exp\\left\\{-\\int_0^x A\\,dt\\right\\}\\,\\exp\\left\\{-\\int_0^x B\\cdot c^t\\,dt\\right\\}\\\\ &amp;= &amp; \\exp\\{-A x\\}\\,\\exp\\left\\{ - \\frac{B}{\\log(c)} (c^x - 1)\\right\\} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\exp\\left\\{ - Ax - \\frac{B}{\\log(c)} (c^x - 1)\\right\\}. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] 2.3.3 Makeham Law based on Life Expectancies Data The Gompertz-Makeham mortality model is sufficiently rich to represent typical patterns in human mortality. To have workable models for applications for the remainder of the book, we fit the model to our life expectancy data from Section 2.1.1. Formally, we interpret the given life expectancies as (generalized) moments of our model, and then rely on the (generalized) methods of moments (GMM) to pin down the model parameters. We omit statistical details behind GMM (see e.g. this introduction for more details), but intuitively we determine the model parameters that produce model moments that are closest, in the least-squares sense, to the given data. We can then appraise the model fit by analyzing how close the fitted model moments are to the actual moments. In doing so, we R define functions that determine the survival functions and the life expectancy at a given age \\(x\\), where we evaluate the associated integral numerically. We then run a numerical optimization procedure that determines the parameters that best approximate the empirical moments.

However, the resulting force of mortality that is described by three parameters is highly regular. In particular, the likelihood of dying is monotonically increasing over the entire age domain. While this is true across many ages, real-world human mortality often shows a few deviations from these regular patterns. For instance, we often observe a so-called young adult mortality hump arising from risky behavior, involvement in wars, etc. While there exist mortality laws that can account for this and other features, resulting functions quickly become complex and exhibit a low degree of tractability. Hence, a typical approach is to directly specify the survival function \\(S_0(\\cdot)\\) of the lifetime random variable of a newborn within the age-only model and use it for actuarial calculations. Such an approach is often characterized as non-parametric since the survival function is not given as a function of a few given parameters. We will discuss more advanced approaches to estimating non-parametric survival functions from mortality data in Section 2.5. A rather simple approach in this direction is to construct so-called life tables. As we discuss in the first part of this chapter, a life-table is simply an annually-discretized version of the survival function \\(S_0(\\cdot)\\). A substantial advantage is that it is easy to generate such life tables from data in the context of population count data that we encountered in Section 2.1.2, as we will see and do in the second section 2.4.2. The following sections 2.4.4 and 2.4.3 the discuss some in more detail the theoretical underpinnings of life tables based on the so-called curtate lifetime and how to drive quantities for fractional ages based on the annually-discretized representation. Finally, the concluding sections ?? and 2.4.5 discuss more advanced life tables that include underwriting (selection) effects and mortality improvements, respectively. 2.4.1 Life Table Basics Consider a (large) population of \\(l_0\\) homogeneous newborns. Then, if survival in the population follows (exactly) the survival function \\(S_0(\\cdot)\\), at age \\(x\\) there are \\[ l_0 \\times S_0(x) = l_0 \\times {_xp_0} = l_0 \\times P(T_0 \\geq x) = l_x \\] individuals left. Of course, this immediately implies \\({_xp_0} = \\frac{l_x}{l_0}\\) and, similarly, we can derive \\(k\\)-year the survival probability for an \\(x\\)-year old as: \\[ {_kp_x} = \\frac{S_0(x+k)}{S_0(x)} = \\frac{l_0 \\times S_0(x+k)}{l_0 \\times S_0(x)} = \\frac{l_{x+k}}{l_x},\\,x,k=0,1,2,... \\] In particular, the set of \\(l_x,\\,x=0,1,2,...,\\) lets us compute relevant probabilities for integer choices, which is not surprising because they are effectively providing an annually-discredited version of the survival function \\(S_0(\\cdot)\\) in the age-only model. Evidently the so-called radix \\(l_0\\) is immaterial, though it is typically chosen as a large number in line with the population interpretation, so that it is not necessary to display digits. A life table provides exactly the set of \\(l_x,\\,x=0,1,2,...,\\) typically compiled in a tabular manner starting at some initial age (maybe zero for a population table) up to some termimal age \\(\\omega\\) after which all individuals are assumed die, i.e., \\(l_{\\omega + 1} = 0.\\) From the above equation, we immediately obtain: \\[ {_kq_x} = 1 - {_kp_x} = \\frac{l_x - l_{x+k}}{l_x} = \\frac{_kd_x}{l_x},\\,x,k=0,1,2,... \\] where \\(_kd_x\\) denotes the deaths between ages \\(x\\) and \\(x+k\\). In particular, we have: \\[ q_x = 1 - p_x = \\frac{d_x}{l_x} \\Leftrightarrow l_x - l_x\\times p_x = d_x \\Leftrightarrow l_{x+1} = l_x\\times p_x = l_x - d_x,\\,x=0,1,2,... \\] This suggests one way of creating a life table: We could observe a (large) cohort of \\(l_0\\) individuals initially, count the annual deaths \\(d_0,\\) \\(d_1,\\) etc., and tabulate the resulting survivors. The result would be a so-called cohort life table as it reflects survivorship of the observed cohort over time. However, this approach is rather unpractical: we would have to wait until the last person in the cohort has deceased, and by then compiling a life table for an extinct cohort is likely of limited use. The more common approach is to compile a so-called period life table. Here instead of following a particular cohort, we consider a given population over a certain period, e.g. a calendar year. We then use observed population mortality rates \\(q_x\\) in the time period to determine \\(l_x\\) for all ages according to relationship above. We explore this idea using the population mortality data we introduced in Section 2.1.2. 2.4.2 Life Table based on U.S. Population Data In section 2.1.2 we considered exposures and deaths of the U.S. population over time, and in particular in Figure 2.3 we plotted mortality ratesdefined as the fraction of deaths and exposuresreferencing the similarity to the Gompertz-Makeham law from Figure 2.10. It may be tempting to think about this mortality rates as \\(q_x\\) and use it to compile a life table. However, while the two quantities are related, there is a subtle difference: the mortality probability \\(q_x = d_x/l_x\\) considers deaths during age \\(x\\) relative to the population of \\(x\\) year olds. In contrast, the central death rate is defined as the number of deaths each year that have characteristics \\(\\bf{x}\\) at the moment of death in the relevant observation period, divided by the exposures with the same characteristics \\(\\bf{x}\\) over the same period, and is denoted as \\(m_\\bf{x}\\)where as usual we write \\(m_{x}\\) in the age-only model. Hence, in particular the denominator corresponds to the average size of the population at risk, not the population at risk at the outset. To connect \\(q_x\\) and \\(m_x\\), we need to make an assumption about the exposure. One straightforward approach is to assume that the exposures correspond to the arithmetic average of the population size at age \\(x\\) and the population size at age \\(x+1\\), though different approaches are possible as we will see in Section 2.4.4: \\[ m_x \\approx \\frac{d_x}{0.5\\,l_x+ 0.5\\,l_{x+1}} = \\frac{q_x}{1-0.5\\,q_x} \\Longrightarrow q_x = \\frac{2\\,m_x}{2+m_x}. \\] Let us use this relationship to construct a mortality life table using the 2010-2014 U.S.Females and Males data: us_mx &lt;- us_deaths us_mx[,4:6] &lt;- us_deaths[,4:6] / us_exp[,4:6] us_mx_fem_2014 &lt;- us_mx[us_mx$Year_start == 2010,-c(2,5,6)] colnames(us_mx_fem_2014)[colnames(us_mx_fem_2014)==&quot;Female&quot;] &lt;- &quot;mx US Females&quot; us_mx_fem_2014$qx &lt;- 2 * us_mx_fem_2014$mx / (2 + us_mx_fem_2014$mx) colnames(us_mx_fem_2014)[colnames(us_mx_fem_2014)==&quot;qx&quot;] &lt;- &quot;qx US Females&quot; tmp_head_us_mx_fem_2014 &lt;- head(us_mx_fem_2014); rownames(tmp_head_us_mx_fem_2014) &lt;- NULL kable(head(tmp_head_us_mx_fem_2014), align = &quot;ccr&quot;) Year_start Age mx US Females qx US Females 2010 0 0.005461737 0.005446862 2010 1 0.000379927 0.000379855 2010 2 0.000224890 0.000224865 2010 3 0.000169394 0.000169380 2010 4 0.000138322 0.000138313 2010 5 0.000119244 0.000119237 us_mx_mal_2014 &lt;- us_mx[us_mx$Year_start == 2010,-c(2,4,6)] colnames(us_mx_mal_2014)[colnames(us_mx_mal_2014)==&quot;Male&quot;] &lt;- &quot;mx US Males&quot; us_mx_mal_2014$qx &lt;- 2 * us_mx_mal_2014$mx / (2 + us_mx_mal_2014$mx) colnames(us_mx_mal_2014)[colnames(us_mx_mal_2014)==&quot;qx&quot;] &lt;- &quot;qx US Males&quot; tmp_head_us_mx_mal_2014 &lt;- head(us_mx_mal_2014); rownames(tmp_head_us_mx_mal_2014) &lt;- NULL kable(head(tmp_head_us_mx_mal_2014), align = &quot;ccr&quot;) Year_start Age mx US Males qx US Males 2010 0 0.006554279 0.006532870 2010 1 0.000441664 0.000441567 2010 2 0.000298869 0.000298824 2010 3 0.000225097 0.000225072 2010 4 0.000184733 0.000184715 2010 5 0.000145992 0.000145981 The death probability curves for the U.S. Females and Males data are depicted in both original and logarithmic scales, and displayed as Figure ??.

As indicated before, these intricacies are not accounted for by the Gompertz-Makeham and other simple parametric models. Moreover, significant differences at ages 50 to 70 are also observed, and are due to health related factors that males around the world tend to be exposed earlier than females. We are now able to construct a period life table based on the U.S. mortality data. Using the relationships from before: \\[ l_{x+1}=l_x\\cdot p_x=l_x\\big(1-q_x\\big)\\quad\\text{for all integers}\\quad x. \\] and fixing \\(l_0 = 1,000,000\\), we generate \\(l_x\\), \\(x=0,1,2,...\\), for the male and female life table: lf &lt;- rep(0,length(us_mx_fem_2014$mx)) lf[1] &lt;- 1000000 for (i in 2:111){ lf[i] = lf[i-1] * (1-us_mx_fem_2014[i-1,4]) } us_mx_fem_2014$lf &lt;- lf lm &lt;- rep(0,length(us_mx_mal_2014$mx)) lm[1] &lt;- 1000000 for (i in 2:111){ lm[i] = lm[i-1] * (1-us_mx_mal_2014[i-1,4]) } us_mx_mal_2014$lm &lt;- lm Resulting in, for females: library(DT) tmp_life_table_us_mx_fem_2014 &lt;- round(us_mx_fem_2014, digits = 9); colnames(tmp_life_table_us_mx_fem_2014)[5]&lt;- &quot;lx US Females&quot; rownames(tmp_life_table_us_mx_fem_2014) &lt;- NULL #kable(tmp_life_table_us_mx_fem_2014, digits = 9, format.args = list(big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), align = &quot;ccrrr&quot;) DT::datatable(tmp_life_table_us_mx_fem_2014) And for males: tmp_life_table_us_mx_mal_2014 &lt;-round(us_mx_mal_2014, digits = 9); colnames(tmp_life_table_us_mx_mal_2014)[5]&lt;- &quot;lx US Males&quot; rownames(tmp_life_table_us_mx_mal_2014) &lt;- NULL #kable(tmp_life_table_us_mx_mal_2014, digits = 9, format.args = list(big.mark = &quot;,&quot;), align = &quot;ccrrr&quot;) DT::datatable(tmp_life_table_us_mx_mal_2014) The \\(l_x\\) values are now plotted in Figure 2.13 where once again the female subpopulation shows higher survivorship trend than the male subpopulation.

However, when relying on the sizable U.S. population, the resulting quantities are fairly smooth as illustrated by Figures 2.12 and 2.13. Hence, we will rely on them without adjustments. We can rely on the life table to determine various actuarial quantities, at integer ages and for integer durations. For instance, we can determine the survival probabilities \\(_kp_{50}\\) for a 50-year-old female for all choices of \\(k=0,1,2,...\\): kP50 &lt;- us_mx_fem_2014$l[51:111]/us_mx_fem_2014$l[51] R Code For Figure plot(kP50,xlab=&quot;age&quot;, type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 5, col = &quot;red&quot;) Figure 2.14: kPx for a 50-year old female Or we can determine \\(_{10|20}q_{50}\\), the probability that a 50-year old survives for 10 years and then dies within the next 20 years via \\(\\frac{l_{60}-l_{80}}{l_{50}}\\): (us_mx_fem_2014$l[61] - us_mx_fem_2014$l[81])/us_mx_fem_2014$l[51] [1] 0.281351377 2.4.3 Curtate Quantities and Recursive Relationships Rather than thinking about life tables as an annually-discretized version of the survival function of \\(T_0\\) within the age-only model, it is also possible to interpret a life table as providing probabilities of a discretized version of the lifetime random variable. This is referred to as the curtate future lifetime. Formally, the curtate future lifetime \\(K_{\\bf{x}}\\) is given by the greatest integer of \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\): \\(K_{\\bf{x}} = \\lfloor T_{\\bf{x}} \\rfloor\\), i.e. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} K_{\\bf{x}} = 0 &amp; \\text{ if } &amp; T_{\\bf{x}} &lt; 1\\\\ K_{\\bf{x}} = 1 &amp; \\text{ if } &amp; 1\\leq T_{\\bf{x}} &lt; 2\\\\ &amp;...&amp;\\\\ K_x = {\\bf{x}} &amp; \\text{ if } &amp; k \\leq T_{\\bf{x}} &lt; k+1,\\, k \\in {\\mathbb N}. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Therefore, \\(K_{\\bf{x}}\\) describes the number of whole future years lived by an individual with characteristics \\({\\bf{x}}\\) prior to death. Therefore, the probability function of the (discrete) distribution of \\(K_{\\bf{x}}\\) is: \\[ Pr(K_{\\bf{x}} = k) = Pr(k \\leq T_{\\bf{x}} &lt; k+1) = {_kp_{\\bf{x}}} - {_{k+1}p_{\\bf{x}}} = {_{k\\mid 1}q_{\\bf{x}}} = {_{k\\mid}q_{\\bf{x}}},\\,k=0,1,... \\] Just as for the lifetime, the expected value of \\(K_x\\) corresponds to a life expectancy, though this is a curtate version of life expectancy. It is denoted by \\(e_{\\bf{x}}\\), and its calculation can be obtained by summing up the \\({_kp_{\\bf{x}}}\\) in analogy to the derivation of (complete) life expectancy: \\[ e_{\\bf{x}} = E[K_{\\bf{x}}]= \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} {_kp_{\\bf{x}}}. \\] Derivation of Formula for Curtate Life Expectancy \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} e_{\\bf{x}} &amp;=&amp; E[K_{\\bf{x}}] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k \\, Pr(K_{\\bf{x}}=k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k\\, ({_kp_{\\bf{x}}} - {_{k+1}p_{\\bf{x}}}) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k\\, {_kp_{\\bf{x}}}-\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (k+1)\\, {_{k+1}p_{\\bf{x}}} + \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} {_{k+1}p_{\\bf{x}}}\\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} {_kp_{\\bf{x}}}. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] As before, in the age-only model we write \\({\\bf{x}}=x\\), and in this case we can express the curtate expected lifetime of an \\(x\\)-year old by the corresponding value for an \\(x+1\\) year old: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} e_x &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} {_kp_x} = p_x \\,\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} {_{k-1}p_{x+1}} = p_x\\,{_0p_{x+1}} + p_x\\,\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} {_{k-1}p_{x+1}} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; p_x + p_x \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} {_{i}p_{x+1}} = p_x + p_x \\cdot e_{x+1} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] or \\[ e_{x} = p_x\\left(1+e_{x+1}\\right) \\Leftrightarrow e_{x+1} = \\frac{e_x - p_x}{p_x}. \\] This recursive formula states that the expected future lifetime for an \\(x\\)-year-old in whole years will be non-zero for the survivors until age \\(x+1\\) only, and for those it will be the expected future lifetime in whole years for an \\(x+1\\)-year-old individual plus the one year they already have survived. Curtate life expectancies are straightforward to calculate from a life table. For instance, using our life table for females, we obtain for curtate life expectancy at birth is: kP0f &lt;- us_mx_fem_2014$l/us_mx_fem_2014$l[1] e_0 &lt;- sum(kP0f) - 1 e_0 [1] 80.7955575 which is close to the Figure from the U.S. national statistics from Section 2.1.1, where the female life expectancy for 2017 is recorded as 81.1 years. We are also now in a position to elaborate on the caveat at the end of that section on the interpretation of this number: This is a so-called period life expectancy as it was derived from a period life table. So rather than reflecting the prospective life expectancy of a newborn today, it describes how long a hypothetical newborn that will have the mortality patterns observed in the population within this period will be expected to live. We will attempt to derive a more representative figure for a 50-year old alive today that will experience future mortality rates in Section 2.4.5. Indeed, an interesting and revealing exercise is to go through past years of data that we have available in our population count data from Section 2.1.2, and derive life expectancies for past periods. We consider newborn and fifty-year-old females. We obtain this by essentially repeating the same exercise we carried out in the previous section to assemble the life table for every time period.

This is a familiar observation from demography, where it is pointed out that various limits on life expectancy that were previously assumed have been broken. 2.4.4 Fractional year assumptions Let us consider the complete life expectancy in the age-only model for an \\(x\\)-year old life or, more precisely, the recursive relationship: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x} &amp;=&amp; \\int_0^{\\infty} {_tp_x}\\,dt = \\int_0^{1} {_tp_x}\\,dt +\\int_1^{\\infty} {_tp_x}\\,dt = \\int_0^{1} {_tp_x}\\,dt +p_x\\,\\int_1^{\\infty} {_{t-1}p_{x+1}}\\,dt \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\underbrace{\\int_0^{1} {_tp_x}\\,dt}_{e_{\\overline{x:1|}}} +p_x\\,\\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x+1}. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] In order to derive the life expectancy from a life table with a terminal age \\(\\omega\\), we could rely on this recursion. Clearly \\(\\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{\\omega}=0\\), so to derive \\(\\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x}\\) for \\(x=\\omega-1,\\,\\omega-2,...,1,0\\), we can employ the \\(p_x\\) as denoted in the life table. However, we also need to compute \\(\\int_0^{1} {_tp_x}\\,dt\\) and, thus, we need to know how \\(_tp_x\\) evolves within one year or, in other words, for . The common way in actuarial practice to solve this problem, but also to derive quantities like \\({_{1.5}p_{55}}\\) or \\({_{10}q_{22.5}}\\), is to use interpolation schemes, i.e. to make an assumption on the distribution of \\(S_0(x)\\)or, equivalently, \\(l_x\\)between integers. One of the most common assumptions is that of a uniform distribution of deaths within each year of age (UDD). To illustrate, note that the number of deaths within the population of \\(x\\)-year olds is \\[ d_x = l_x \\times q_x. \\] The UDD assumption is that in, say, half of the year, half of the people die; similarly, say, in a third of the year, a third of the people die, i.e. \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} {_{0.5}d_x} &amp;=&amp; 0.5\\times d_x, \\\\ {_{0.333}d_x} &amp;=&amp; 0.333 \\times d_x \\end{eqnarray*}\\] or, in general, \\[ {_{t}d_x} = t\\times d_x, \\;0\\ \\leq t \\leq 1, \\] which implies \\[ {_tq_x} = \\frac{_td_x}{l_x} = t \\frac{d_x}{l_x} = t\\times q_x, \\;0\\ \\leq t \\leq 1. \\] Of course, we can also express this relationship in terms of the survival function: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+t)}{S_(x)} = {_tq_x} &amp;=&amp; t\\cdot q_x = t\\;\\frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+1)}{S_0(x)} \\\\ \\Rightarrow S_0(x+t) &amp;=&amp; S_0(x) + t \\left(S_0(x+1) - S_0(x)\\right), \\;0\\ \\leq t \\leq 1. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Thus, this assumption is equivalent to assuming a linear interpolation of the survival function bewteen integers. Based on the survival function and the familiar relationships, we can now derive all other actuarial quantities in terms of the discrete amount of quantities denoted in the life table; for example, for the survival probability we obtain: \\[ {_tp_x} = 1- {_tq_x} = 1 - t\\times q_x, \\;0\\ \\leq t \\leq 1; \\] and for the force of mortality: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mu_{x+t} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{-S_0&#39;(x+t)}{S_0(x+t)} = \\frac{-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}{_{x+t}p_0}}{{_{x+t}p_0}} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{{_xp_0}\\,\\left(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}{_tp_x}\\right)}{{_xp_0}\\,{_{t}p_x}} = \\frac{q_x}{1-t\\cdot q_x}, \\;0\\ \\leq t \\leq 1. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] In order to determine probabilities for fractional starting ages, let us first consider the probability to die within the second part of some given year, i.e. \\(_{1-t}q_{x+t}\\), \\(0\\ \\leq t \\leq 1:\\) the probability to die before age \\(x+1\\) for some \\(x+t\\) year old life, where \\(x\\) is integer valued. The probability to survive for \\(t\\) periods and to then die within the remaining \\(1-t\\) periods plus the probability to die within the first \\(t\\) periods clearly must equal the probability to die within the whole year, i.e. \\[ {_tp_x} \\times {_{1-t}q_{x+t}} + {_tq_x} =\\frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}\\frac{S_0(x+t) - S_0(x+1))}{S_0(x+t)} + \\frac{S_0(x)-S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)} = \\frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+1)}{S_0(x)} = {q_x} \\] and, therefore: \\[ {_{1-t}q_{x+t}} = \\frac{q_x - t\\times q_x}{_tp_x} = \\frac{(1-t)\\times q_x}{1-t\\times q_x}. \\] For the probability to die before age \\(x+t+u\\) for an \\((x+t)\\)-year old life, where \\(0 \\leq u &lt; 1-t\\), we can rely on the same reasoning as above: In the \\((1-t)\\) time periods between age \\(x+t\\) and \\(x+1\\), a proportion of \\(_{1-t}q_{x+t}\\) of the entire population die. Thus, in the first \\(u\\) time periods, \\(\\frac{u}{1-t}\\) as many people will die, i.e. \\[ {_{u}q_{x+t}} = \\frac{u}{1-t} {_{1-t}q_{x+t}} = \\frac{u}{1-t}\\frac{(1-t)\\,q_x}{1-t\\,q_x} = \\frac{u\\,q_x}{1-t\\,q_x}. \\] However, we could have also simply relied on the interpolation scheme for \\(S_0(x)\\) and applied the familiar formulas. Finally, for the integral within the recursion for the life expectation, we have \\[ \\int_0^1 {_tp_x}\\,dt = \\int_0^1 1 - t\\,q_x\\,dt = 1 - q_x \\left.\\frac{1}{2}t^2\\right|_{t=0}^1 = \\frac{1 + p_x}{2}. \\] Note that this implies that under the UDD assumption: \\[ m_x = \\frac{d_x}{\\int_0^1 l_{x+s}\\,ds}=\\frac{l_x\\,q_x}{l_x\\,\\int_0^1 {_tp_x}\\,dt} = \\frac{q_x}{1-0.5\\,q_x}, \\] which is exactly the relationship we used in relating \\(m_x\\) and \\(q_x\\) in the previous section to construct our life table. That is, we implictly relied on a UDD assumption. Similarly, connecting to our motivational example, under UDD we obtain: \\[ \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x} = \\frac{1}{2} + e_x, \\] so that our observations for the curtate life expectancies will closely resemble those for the complete life expectancies. Derivation of Relationship between Curtate and Complete Life Expectancy under UDD \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,p_x + p_x \\,\\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x+1} = \\frac{1}{2} + p_x\\,(\\frac{1}{2}+\\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x+1})\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{2} + p_x\\,(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,p_{x+1} + p_{x+1} \\,\\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x+2}) = \\frac{1}{2} + p_x + {_2p_x}\\,(\\frac{1}{2}+\\stackrel{\\circ}{e}_{x+2})\\\\ &amp;=&amp; ...\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{2} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\inft} {_kp_x} = \\frac{1}{2} + e_x. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] An alternate common assumption is that the force of mortality remains constant over the year (constant force assumption): \\[ p_x = e^{-\\int_0^1 \\mu_{x+t}\\,dt} = e^{-\\mu_x}, \\] where \\(\\mu_{x+t} = \\mu_{x},\\;0 \\leq t &lt; 1\\), which immediately yields \\[ \\mu_{x+t} = \\mu_x = -\\log\\left\\{p_x\\right\\},\\;0 \\leq t &lt; 1, \\] and, hence: \\[ {_tp_x} = e^{-\\int_0^t \\mu_{x+t}\\,dt} = e^{-\\mu_x\\,t} = p_x^t. \\] This, on the other hand, implies: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)} &amp;=&amp; \\left(\\frac{S_0(x+1)}{S_0(x)}\\right)^t \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\; S_0(x+t) &amp;=&amp; S_0(x)\\left(\\frac{S_0(x+1)}{S_0(x)}\\right)^t,\\;0\\leq t &lt; 1, \\end{eqnarray*}\\] so we are looking at an scheme. Clearly, all other quantities can now again be derived on the basis of \\(S_0(x+t)\\). In particular, for the central death rate, we obtain: \\[ m_{x}=\\frac{q_x}{\\int_0^1 {_tp_x}\\;dt}=\\frac{1-e^{-\\mu_x}}{\\int_0^1 e^{-\\mu_x \\,t}\\;dt}=\\frac{1-e^{-\\mu_x}}{\\big(1-e^{-\\mu_x}\\big)/\\mu_x}=\\mu_x, \\] yielding the relationship: \\[ q_x = 1-e^{-\\mu_{x}} = 1-e^{-m_x}. \\] This is an alternate, similarly common way of connecting \\(q_x\\) and \\(m_x\\) in constructing life tables. The differences are relatively minor. 2.4.5 Cohort Life Tables and Mortality Improvement Modeling When compiling a period life table as we did in this chapter, we are relying on a snapshot of mortality experience for a given year or a given period. However, for a life insurance company selling annuities, in order to adequately price and reserve for their future liabilities, it is necessary to take into account future changes in mortality. As we have seen in Figure 2.15, life expectancies have changed substantially over the last decades. This means that a female born today may not have the same life expectancy \\(e_{0}\\) that we determined from our period life table (81.8, which as close to the U.S. national figure of 81.1 years) One simple way of describing how mortality changed across years and ages are so-called mortality improvement factors, i.e. the percentage reduction in the mortality rate for each age \\(x\\) over successive years (\\(t-1\\) to \\(t\\)): \\[ \\varphi(x,t) = 1 - \\frac{q_{x,t}}{q_{x,t-1}}. \\] where now \\(q_{x,t}\\) is the mortality probability for an \\(x\\)-year-old at time \\(t\\). In particular, this is a deviation from the age-only model since we have a bivariate \\({\\bf{x}}=(x,t)\\). Let us consider mortality improvement factors in our dataset. Since we consider data in five-year intervals, we scale to one year: \\[ \\varphi(x,t) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{q_{x,t}}{q_{x,t-5}}\\right)^{1/5}. \\] One way of visualizing is a so-called heat map: R Code For Figure us_mx_fem &lt;- us_mx[,-c(2,5,6)] colnames(us_mx_fem)[colnames(us_mx_fem)==&quot;Female&quot;] &lt;- &quot;mx&quot; us_mx_fem$qx &lt;- 1-exp(-us_mx_fem$mx) phi &lt;- matrix(rep(0,111*15),nrow=111,ncol=15,byrow = TRUE) for (t in 1:15){ for (x in 1:111){ phi[x,t] &lt;- 1 - (us_mx_fem[t*111+x,4]/us_mx_fem[(t-1)*111+x,4])^(1/5) } } heatmap(phi,Colv = NA,Rowv = NA,labCol = seq(1935,2010,5), xlab=&quot;Year&quot;, ylab=&quot;Age&quot;, main=&quot;Mortality Improvements&quot;) legend(x=&quot;right&quot;, legend=c(&quot;low&quot;, &quot;med&quot;, &quot;high&quot;),fill=heat.colors(3)) Figure 2.16: Heatmap for Mortality Improvements for U.S. Females Across Times and Ages As we can see, mortality improvements vary quiet a bit over time and age, but we do see quite substantial improvements for low to medium ages in the more recent past. One interesting aspect here is that clearly there is a relationship between time and age. For a certain birth cohort, as time passes, the individuals will age. In particular, we identify the diagonals in the heatmap with a certain birth cohort, and we observe some distinct relationships on the diagonals. For instance, the cohort if individuals born around 1950 appears to experience quite substantial improvements across all years of age, which could be due to environmental or socio-economic factors. One simple way of accounting for improvements and forecasting mortality into the future are so-called single factor mortality improvement models, i.e. models where \\(\\varphi(x,t)\\) only depends on \\(x\\)  lets write \\(\\varphi_x\\). With that, the above equation becomes: \\[ q_{x,t}= q_{x,t-1}\\times (1- \\varphi_x), \\] or, generalizing: \\[ q_{x,t} = q_{x,0}\\times (1-\\varphi_x)^t \\] To obtain suitable improvement factors for making projections, for deriving \\(\\phi_x\\) lets average across years under consideration and smooth across ages using a simple local regression smoother: R Code For Figure phi_x &lt;- rep(0,111) for (x in 1:111){ phi_x[x] &lt;- mean(phi[x,]) } ages &lt;- 1:111 lo &lt;- loess(phi_x ~ ages) plot(phi_x, type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 5, col = &quot;red&quot;, main=&quot;Mortality Improvement Factors, US Females&quot;, xlab = &quot;age&quot;, ylab = &quot;phi&quot;) lines(predict(lo), col=&#39;blue&#39;, lwd=2) phi_x &lt;- predict(lo) Figure 2.17: Mortality Improvement Factors for U.S. Females It is important to stress that we are no longer in the age-only model, since now a seventy-year-old today and a seventy-year-old ten years from now. However, as we already indicated in Section 2.2.3, in this case of a bivariate \\(\\bf{x}\\) where one of the covariatesyear of birthis immutable for an individual, we can still rely on the same ideas as in the age-only model. Hence, in particular, we can still defined life tables, although life tables will now be two dimensional since we will have different \\(q_{x,t}\\) for every year \\(t\\). To illustrate, let us create a cohort life table for fifty year old females now, where for simplicity we denote the current time by \\(t=0\\) (corresponding to the timing of the period life table we created). Then we can obtain prospective mortality probabilities \\(q_{50+t,t}\\) via: \\[ q_{50+t,t} = q_{50+t,0} \\times (1-\\varphi_{50+t})^t. \\] Let us plot these cohort mortality probabilities and compare them to our period mortality probabilities: R Code For Figure q_50plusx &lt;- rep(0,61) for (i in 1:61){ q_50plusx[i] &lt;- us_mx_fem_2014[50+i,4] * (1 - phi_x[50+i])^(i-1) } plot(50:99,q_50plusx[1:50], type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 2, col = &quot;red&quot;, main=&quot;q_x comparison&quot;, xlab = &quot;age&quot;) lines(50:99,us_mx_fem_2014[51:100,4], col = &quot;blue&quot;, lwd = 2) Figure 2.18: Cohort (red) vs. Period (blue) q_x for 50-year old U.S. females Evidently the cohort mortality probabilities are lower than the period mortality probabilities, as we incorporate mortality improvements. Of course, this comes with the assumption that the future mortality evolution will be similar to that in the past. While critical, it is not possible to make a projections without any assumption, and reliance on a period table is equivalent to assuming there will not be improvements whatsoever. These \\(q_{50+t,t}\\) and now be relied on for determining actuarial quantities just as in the previous section. If we use all ages \\(x\\) today and determine corresponding \\(q_{x+t,t}\\), \\(t=0,1,2,...\\), \\(x=0,1,2,...\\), just as above, we obtain a two-dimensional cohort or projective life table. In particular, we can consider newborn females and determine their (curtate) life expectancy, resulting in: R Code For Cohort Life Expectancy q_0plusx &lt;- rep(0,110) for (i in 1:110){ q_0plusx[i] &lt;- us_mx_fem_2014[i,4] * (1 - phi_x[i])^(i-1) } kP0_i &lt;- rep(0,110) kP0_i[1] &lt;- 1 for (i in 2:110){ kP0_i[i] &lt;- kP0_i[i-1] * (1 - q_0plusx[i-1]) } e_0Coh &lt;- sum(kP0_i) - 1 e_0Coh [1] 88.1249429 Hence, due to mortality improvements, our projected life expectancy is substantially larger than that based on our period table of 80.8 years from Section 2.4.3 or that based U.S. national statistics of 81.1 from Section 2.1.1. 2.5 Non-parametric survival estimation The previous section introduced life tables as a (discretized) representation of a non-parametric survival function in the age-only model. We also showed how to compile a period life table based on (population) mortality count data, essentially by deriving mortality rates from a given time window. How can we determine a life tableor, more generally, a survival functionfrom mortality data at the individual level, which an insurance company has available, such as the dataset we introduced in Section 2.1.3? One approach is to follow a similar path as in the previous section, by translating the individual outcomes into counts and the proceeding similarly. However, the number of deaths within a given year and at a certain age may be rather limited for a single companys portfolio, especially when constraining the individuals to a certain subgroup determined by sex, smoking status, health, etc. Therefore, in practice life tables are often compiled at the industry level, such as within the so-called Valuation Basic Table by the American Academy of Actuaries. The current section discusses non-parametric estimation of survival functions based on a individual level mortality dataset that inlcudes truncated and censored data, where we rely on the dataset from Section 2.1.3 for illustration. In anaology to the previous section, the setting here is the age-only approach, i.e., we determine one survival curve that reflects mortality as a function of age. However, by constraining the dataset to certain subrgoups, we can generate different survival curves for these different subgroups. We commence by introducing the Kaplan-Meier (product limit) approach for estimating the survival curve and then discuss the Nelson-Aalen estimator for the cumulative hazard. 2.5.1 Kaplan-Meier Estimate The intuition for the Kaplan-Meier estimate is straightforward. Recall from Section 2.2.3 that in the age-only model, for the survival function for \\(x\\)-year-olds we have: \\[ S_x(0) = 1 \\text{ and } S_x(t+1) = S_x(t) \\times p_{x+t} \\] for integer \\(x\\) and \\(t\\). Furthermore, from the previous section on life tables, given information on exposures \\(l_{x+t}\\) and deaths \\(d_{x+t}\\) at time \\(x+t\\), we estimate: \\[ p_{x+t} = 1 - \\frac{d_{x+t}}{l_{x+t}} \\Longrightarrow S_x(t+1) = S_x(t) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{d_{x+t}}{l_{x+t}}\\right). \\] The Kaplan-Meier estimate uses the exact same relationship, although it takes into account that in the context of right-censored individual mortality data, potential exposures at each death time may be different. That is, \\(l_{x+t}\\) in this equation should be interpreted as the total number of individuals at risk of dying at time \\(x+t\\). This number will change across time because individuals die and because of right-censoring, so indviduals falling outside of the observation window. As a consequence, the survival function is updated whenever there is a death event, and the number of corresponding exposures is recalculated at every point. For additional details as well as a discussion of how to determine the variance of the estimate, we refer to Section 4.3.2 in Loss Data Analystics. An important caveat to the application of the Kaplan-Meier estimate is that all exposures are treated alike in the context of the age-only model. Hence, individuals of the same age at different times are entering the survival curve estimate. In particular, the set of observations that is used for estimating the survival curve determines the population for which the survival curve is relevant. In R, we can use the library survival. We estimate survival curves based on our insurer dataset from Section 2.1.3 for ages 30, 40, and 50, where we compare survival curves for males, females, and the aggregate curves. Let us plot them curves.

The curves for all genders are closer to the equivalent curves based on the male data, since the synthetic dataset has \\(70\\%\\) male policyholders, as explained in the data summary given in Section 2.1.3. 2.5.2 Nelson-Aalen The Nelson-Aalen estimator provides a non-parametric estimat of the cumulative hazard rate function \\[ A_x(t) =\\int_0^t \\mu_x(s)\\,ds. \\] We have for the cumulative hazard rate: \\[ S_x(t+1) = \\exp\\{-A_x(t+1)\\}=S_x(t)\\,\\exp\\{-(A_x(t+1)-A_x(t))\\}=S_x(t)\\,\\frac{l_{x+t+1}}{l_{x+t}}. \\] To provide intuition for the Nelson-Aalen estimator, recall that for `small arguments, the exponential function \\(e^y \\approx 1 + y\\). Therefore, we have: \\[ 1 - (A_x(t+1)-A_x(t)) \\approx \\frac{l_{x+t+1}}{l_{x+t}} \\Longrightarrow A_x(t+1) \\approx A_x(t) + \\frac{d_{x+t}}{l_{x+t}}. \\] However, in analogy to the derivation of the Kaplan-Meier estimat, the Nelson-Aalen estimator takes into account that in the context of right-censored individual mortality data, potential exposures at each death time may be different. That is, \\(l_{x+t}\\) in this equation should be interpreted as the total number of individuals at risk of dying at time \\(x+t\\). This number will change across time because individuals die and because of right-censoring, so indviduals falling outside of the observation window. And, again, the estimator updates whenever there is a death event. The esimator thus amounts to nothing else than the sum of deaths over exposures. Again we refer to Section 4.3.2 in Loss Data Analystics for more information. Using the library survival, we can also obtain Nelson-Aalen estimates of the survival curve. We estimate survival curves based on our insurer dataset from Section 2.1.3 for females and ages 30, 40, and 50.

Since the Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimators provide a full non-parametric estimate of the survival curve, we can directly use it for evaluating quantities depending on the distribution of the lifetime random variable. In principle, there is no need to discretize it to compile a life table  although thats certainly possible. To reiterate, the approach in the application is to assemble a suitable set of lives and determine a survival function viewing these lives as a (sufficiently) homogeneous population. In the next section, we consider survival analysis models that explicitly account for the heterogeneity of individuals exposures by accounting for their characteristics. 2.6 Conditional models: Survival regression All models introduced in the foregoing sections 2.3 (analytic mortality laws), 2.4 (life tables based on mortality count data), and 2.5 (non-parametric estimates of the survival curve based on a homogeneous population) are based on the age-only model that  with some qualifications (see, e.g., Section 2.4.5). However, as introduced in Section 2.1.3, individual survival or event data that an insurance company has available consists of features or covariates \\({\\bf{x}}_i\\) for each individual \\(i\\), plus the death time \\(T_i\\) if the individual had died or  if thats not the case  the information that the individual is still alive. Hence, a proximate approach is to directly model the individual lifetime distribution \\(T_{{\\bf{x}}_i}\\), i.e., to explicitly account for the heterogeneity in the individuals exposures. This can be accomplished via so-called survival regression models that predict the distribution of \\(T_{{\\bf{x}}}\\) based on a set of features \\({\\bf{x}}_i\\) and death times \\(T_i\\), \\(i=1,2,\\cdots,N\\). Our objective is to introduce some key ideas and to derive workable models. Therefore, we primarily focus on the most popular model  namely the proportional hazard (Cox) model  and consider linear models in the features. A detailed introduction of this rich set of models is beyond the scope of this text, although we note that in principle more sophisticated models can be used. We refer to the Notes and Comments section at the end of this chapter for references that go beyond our introduction. We start by introducing the Cox proportional hazard model in the first part. We apply it to our individual level mortality dataset from Section 2.1.3 in the second part. And, finally, we show how to produce different models and life tables on the basis of the regression model. 2.6.1 The Cox Proportional Hazard Model The task at hand is to formulate a model for the individual survival function \\(S_{\\bf{x}}(\\cdot)\\) given a feature vector \\(\\bf{x}\\). Concretely, this may mean specifying a parametric model, i.e., to posit that \\(S_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\) takes a certain functional form of time \\(t\\), the features \\(\\bf{x}\\), and certain parameters, say \\(\\beta\\). We can then try to estimate the parameters based on our data \\(({\\bf{x}}_i,T_i)_{1\\leq i \\leq N}\\). However, a key challenge are the boundedness and monotonicity constraints for the survival function \\(S_{\\bf{x}}(\\cdot)\\). Therefore, it is common in survival analysis to model the individual force of mortality (or hazard function) \\(\\mu_{\\bf{x}}(\\cdot)\\). In principle, \\(\\mu_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\) can take any positive number, although as we had discussed in Section @ref{S:AnalMortLaws} a humans force of mortality typically increases in age. Hence, a common approach in survival analysis is to posit that \\(\\mu_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\) takes a certain functional form of time \\(t\\), the features \\(\\bf{x}\\), and parameters \\(\\beta\\), and then try to estimate the parameters based on our data \\(({\\bf{x}}_i,T_i)_{1\\leq i \\leq N}\\). Different functional forms are possible. For example, additive survvial regression models specify \\(\\mu_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\) as a linear combination of the features, similarly to linear regression models. However, the most popular approach  due to its tractability and fit in many situations  is the so-called Cox proportional hazard model. In its simplest form, it assumes the force of mortality takes the form: \\[ \\mu_{\\bf{x}}(t)=\\beta_0(t) \\times \\exp\\left\\{ \\beta&#39; \\,{\\bf{x}}\\right\\}, \\] in which \\(\\beta\\) is the vector of regression parameters. The non-parametric term \\(\\beta_0(t)\\) is also referred to as the parameter when the emphasis is on the estimation of the regression coefficients. It is also possible to allow for time-varying covariates: \\[ \\mu_{\\bf{x}}(t) = \\beta_0(t)\\times\\exp\\left\\{\\beta&#39;\\, {\\bf{x}}(t)\\right\\}, \\] where \\({\\bf{x}}(t)\\) are (possibly) time-varying covariates. Since the covariates are given, we in order to obtain (an estimate for) \\(\\mu_{\\bf{x}}(t)\\), we need to estimate the parameter vector \\(\\beta\\). We outline the estimation process below, although the details are not crucial for the material that follows. Estimation of the Regression Parameters in the Proportional Hazards Model For a set of \\(N\\) independent subjects, define the observation time \\(X_i = \\min\\{T_i, C_i\\}\\), \\(i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}\\), where \\(T_i\\) is time until death and \\(C_i\\) is the censoring time (time until end of observation period) for subject \\(i\\). The indicator for observed death of subject \\(i\\) is defined as \\(\\Delta_i = 1_{\\{T_i &lt; C_i\\}}\\). We further define the \\(i\\)-th at-risk and observed-death counting processes as \\(Y_i(t)=1_{\\{X_i\\ge t\\}}\\) and \\(N_i(t)=1_{\\{T_i\\le t,\\Delta_i=1\\}}\\), respectively. The likelihood-based estimation relies on a similar idea as the Nelson-Aalen estimator from Section 2.5: We determine parameters such that the observed death of individual \\(i\\) at time \\(T_i\\) is most likely amount all possible death. More precisely, the likelihood for individual \\(i\\) is \\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\frac{\\mu_{\\bf{x_i}}(T_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^N Y_j(T_i)\\,\\mu_{\\bf{x_j}}(T_i)}=\\frac{\\exp\\left\\{\\beta&#39;\\, {\\bf{x}_i}(T_i)\\right\\}}{\\sum_{j=1}^N Y_j(T_i)\\,\\exp\\left\\{\\beta&#39;\\, {\\bf{x}}_j(T_i)\\right\\}}, \\] and the total likelihood \\(L(\\beta) = \\prod_i L_i(\\beta)\\). The partial log-likelihood function can then be expressed as: \\[ l(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\Delta_i\\left\\{\\beta&#39;\\, {\\bf{x}}_i(T_i) - \\ln\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n Y_j(T_i)\\exp\\left\\{\\beta&#39;\\, {\\bf{x}}_j(T_i)\\right\\} \\right) \\right\\}. \\] Differentiating yields the (partial-likelihood) score function: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} U(\\beta) = \\frac{\\partial l(\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta} &amp; = &amp; \\sum_{i=1}^N \\Delta_i\\Bigg\\{ {\\bf{x}}_i(T_i) - \\underbrace{\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^N Y_j(T_i)\\,{\\bf{x}}_j(T_i)\\exp\\{\\beta&#39;\\, {\\bf{x}}_j(T_i)\\}}{\\sum_{j=1}^n Y_j(T_i)\\exp\\{\\beta&#39;\\, {\\bf{x}}_j(T_i)\\}}}_{\\bar{Z}(T_i)} \\Bigg\\} \\\\ &amp; = &amp; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_0^{\\infty} \\left[ {\\bf{x}}_i(t) - \\bar{Z}(t) \\right] dN_i(t). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] The parameter vector is then estimated as the solution to the score equation \\(U(\\beta)=0\\), without estimating the nuisance parameter \\(\\beta_0(t)\\). 2.6.2 Cox Models Based on Life Insurer Data We estimate proportional hazard models based on our dataset from Section 2.1.3. We start with a simple model that only includes age and sex: \\[ \\mu_{(x_0,s)}(t) = \\beta_0(t)\\,\\exp\\{\\beta_{\\text{age}}(x_0+t)+\\beta_{\\text{male}}\\,1_{\\{s=\\text{male}\\}}\\}=\\underbrace{\\beta_0(t)\\,e^{\\beta_{\\text{age}}\\,t}}_{\\tilde{\\beta}_0(t)}\\,\\exp\\{\\beta_{\\text{age}}\\,x_0+\\beta_{\\text{male}}\\,1_{\\{s=\\text{male}\\}}\\}. \\] In particular, since age enters the equation linearly, although age varies with time, the time variation will be absorbed in the nuisance parameter \\(\\tilde{\\beta}_0(t)\\) so we dont have to account for the time-varying nature of age. Running the model is straightforward relying on the library survival, where we only have to assure that we label the censored vs. non-censored event times appropriately: ins_data &lt;- fread(&quot;Data/SyntheticInsurerData.csv&quot;,data.table=FALSE) library(survival) CensorTime &lt;- (781-ins_data$Month_of_Sale)/12 ins_data$EventTime &lt;- rep(0,160781) ins_data$EventTime[is.na(ins_data$Time_of_death)] &lt;- CensorTime[is.na(ins_data$Time_of_death)] ins_data$EventTime[!is.na(ins_data$Time_of_death)] &lt;- ins_data$Time_of_death[!is.na(ins_data$Time_of_death)] ins_data$Claim &lt;- 1*(ins_data$Claim == &quot;YES&quot;) Cox_ph_1 &lt;- coxph(Surv(EventTime, Claim) ~ Age + Sex, data=ins_data) summary(Cox_ph_1) Call: coxph(formula = Surv(EventTime, Claim) ~ Age + Sex, data = ins_data) n= 160781, number of events= 59382 coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(&gt;|z|) Age 0.117981709 1.125223530 0.000469934 251.060 &lt; 2.22e-16 *** Sex 0.390607312 1.477878055 0.009256317 42.199 &lt; 2.22e-16 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 Age 1.12522 0.888712 1.12419 1.12626 Sex 1.47788 0.676646 1.45131 1.50493 Concordance= 0.812 (se = 0.001 ) Likelihood ratio test= 71813.2 on 2 df, p=&lt;2e-16 Wald test = 63529.2 on 2 df, p=&lt;2e-16 Score (logrank) test = 72775.3 on 2 df, p=&lt;2e-16 We obtain positive coefficients for age and sex. Indeed, the coefficient is similar  though slightly larger  than the Gompertz coefficients \\(c\\) in Section 2.3. Note that this does not mean that mortality rates for this insured poulation, it just means that the increase in age is steeper. Indeed, a steeper, hockey-stick shaped mortality curve associated with a compression of mortality  sometimes referred to as rectangularization  for certain populations with higher life expectancies is not uncommon. We also observe a positive sign for the Male coefficient implying higher mortality for males, compared to females of the same age. The key advantage of the proportional hazard model is that we can take into account all features. A model building process may contemplate the (statistical) significance of the different covariates. We may also probe whether a linear model is appropriate for the different features, or whether their influence is better captured via non-linear relationships. Furthermore, we may analyze whether interactions of the features are relevant. Different models can be compared based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC), where the objective is to determine a model with a low AIC: extractAIC(Cox_ph_1) [1] 2.00 1220422.68 We leave the exploration of different models to the interested reader, and cut immediately to the model that performs best. This model includes all features, but no interaction or non-linear terms. In analogy to the simple model above, age and potential time (\\(t\\)) effects are absorbed in the nuisance term, so that we do not have to explicitly account for time-varying covariates. Again, we run the model relying on the library survival: Cox_ph_2 &lt;- coxph(Surv(EventTime, Claim) ~ Month_of_Sale + Age + Sex + BloodPressure + Smoking + (BMI&gt;30) , data=ins_data) summary(Cox_ph_2) Call: coxph(formula = Surv(EventTime, Claim) ~ Month_of_Sale + Age + Sex + BloodPressure + Smoking + (BMI &gt; 30), data = ins_data) n= 160781, number of events= 59382 coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(&gt;|z|) Month_of_Sale -0.0010889204 0.9989116723 0.0000327369 -33.2628 &lt; 2.22e-16 *** Age 0.1178051484 1.1250248771 0.0005214675 225.9108 &lt; 2.22e-16 *** Sex 0.3991615411 1.4905743882 0.0092796785 43.0146 &lt; 2.22e-16 *** BloodPressure 0.0162349216 1.0163674240 0.0003058399 53.0831 &lt; 2.22e-16 *** Smoking 0.7832951724 2.1886724491 0.0085781538 91.3128 &lt; 2.22e-16 *** BMI &gt; 30TRUE 0.2736998514 1.3148201015 0.0149480591 18.3101 &lt; 2.22e-16 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 Month_of_Sale 0.998912 1.001090 0.998848 0.998976 Age 1.125025 0.888869 1.123876 1.126175 Sex 1.490574 0.670882 1.463709 1.517933 BloodPressure 1.016367 0.983896 1.015758 1.016977 Smoking 2.188672 0.456898 2.152182 2.225781 BMI &gt; 30TRUE 1.314820 0.760560 1.276858 1.353911 Concordance= 0.828 (se = 0.001 ) Likelihood ratio test= 84426.5 on 6 df, p=&lt;2e-16 Wald test = 71241.8 on 6 df, p=&lt;2e-16 Score (logrank) test = 82479.9 on 6 df, p=&lt;2e-16 We observe that all variables are highly significant. The coefficients for age and sex are similar as in the simpler model above. Similarly, high blood pressure, smoking, and a higher blood pressure lead to a higher mortality, whereas later sales are associated with a lower mortality. The latter amounts to a negative trend in mortality, or in other words increasing longevity over time. As a key application, we can now produce survival curves for a given set of covariates. We consider survival curves for age 75 and different genders and smoking status, and survival curves for for 60-year old feamess with different BMI and blood pressure levels. We consider all of these at the last month of sales in our dataset.

As is evident, the covariates substantially affect the survival functions. Indeed, while 75-year old females have better survival prospects than males (orange vs. green curve on the left-hand side), female smokers are worse off than male non-smokers (green vs. red curve on the left-hand side)  while male smokers have the bleakest survival prospects (blue curve on the left-hand side). Similarly, for the 60-year old females, individuals with the low BMI and low blood pressure with a median future lifetime of more than 30 years (orange curve on the right-hand side), whereas for the highest levels of BMI (40) and systolic blood pressure (180), the median future lifetime is less than 20 years (blue curve on the right-hand side). We notice the inframarginal decrease in the survival probabilities as the BMI exceeds 30. 2.6.3 Conditional Life Tables Recall that a life table is a discretized version of the survival function. Therefore, we can rely on the estimated survival function to generate a life table. We consider the example of a newly underwritten life in the month after the end of our dataset, for a 42-year-old non-smoking male with a BMI of 28 and a blood pressure of 127. We consider the discretized version of the survival function and determine annualized mortality probabilities \\(q_{x+t}\\), according to the formulas provides in Section 2.2.

We notice that the raw mortality probabilities (dots and blue curve) show some irregularities, so we also prvovide a smoothed version based on a local regression fit (via loess). The survival function and the mortality probabilities can be used for actuarial calculations. Life insurance policies have a complex benefit structure that requires knowledge upon the probability of paying the benefits besides many other risk modeling parameters. Policy pricing, meeting the regulatory requirements, and understanding the life portfolio risk performance are all actuarial evaluations that rely on these risk modeling parameters. Mortality risk plays an important role for all of these. In the coming chapters, we discuss how  given (an estimate of) the distribution of the future lifetime random variable \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\)  we can perform these evaluations. In principle, any model discussed in this chapter can be used. As we have seen, models of different degrees of sophistication are possible. What approach is adequate depends on the application in view. For instance, for statutory calculations governed by insurance regulation, often certain life tables are mandated that only account for a limited set of factors (sex, smoking status, etc.). In contrast, when pricing term life insurance policies, the underwriting process can be intricate and resulting information can be leveraged to quote a premium that closely reflects the adopted risk. 2.7 Notes and Comments Reference to Survival analysis textbooks \\(\\require{enclose}\\) "],["C-SimpleBenefit.html", "Chapter 3 Basic Life Contingent Benefits 3.1 Valuation of Cash Flows under Uncertainty 3.2 Life Insurance Benefits 3.3 Life Annuity Benefits 3.4 Valuing Life Contingent Benefits using a Spreadsheet 3.5 Case Study: A Portfolio of Term Insurance Policies 3.6 Further Resources and Contributors", " Chapter 3 Basic Life Contingent Benefits Chapter Preview. This chapter introduces the modeling of life contingent benefits, integrating the material from the previous chapter with basic concepts from financial mathematics. In contrast to benefits that are certain to be paid at specified periods, life contingent benefits have the additional complexity that the timing of payments is uncertain and are contingent upon either the survival or mortality of one or more lives. In this chapter we introduce the calculations of the present values of these contingent benefits, along with associated notation. In this chapter we assume that benefits are paid at annual times. Benefits paid continuously or more frequently than annual time, along with other extensions, are considered in Chapter 4. 3.1 Valuation of Cash Flows under Uncertainty In this section, you learn how to: Express a random cash flow as a product of a discount rate, a potential cash flow amount, and an indicator for the occurrence the cash flow Determine moments of the sum of random cash flows, emphasizing the mean and variance Compute these moments use a spreadsheet approach as well as R statistical software Imagine a financial system with a cash flow of known value \\(_tC\\) occurring in \\(t\\) years from now. If we assume the spot rate of interest is \\(_ti\\) per annum effective, then the present value (\\(PV\\)) of this cash flow is: \\[ PV = ~_tC ~(1+{_ti})^{-t}=~_tC ~ v^t . \\tag{3.1} \\] Let us now introduce uncertainty into this system. Uncertainty might be in terms of the interest rate, the values of the amount, or the timing. In this chapter we assume spot rate \\(_ti\\) is known and that, if a cash flow occurs, the amount \\(_tC\\) is known (as we will see, it is typically set in an insurance contract). The uncertainty is in the timing, that is, whether a cash flow occurs which is represented by an indicator variable. More precisely, we assume that at each time \\(t\\) there is a Bernoulli random variable \\(_tB\\) that is one if a (non-zero) cash flow occurs and 0 otherwise. With this notation, at time \\(t\\), the present value of the random cash flow is \\(v^t \\times ~_tC \\times ~_tB\\). To simplify matters so that we can focus on the foundations, this chapter assumes that timing \\(t\\) can only take on non-negative discrete integer values, denoted as \\(k \\in \\{0,1,2,3, \\ldots\\}\\). This system is illustrated on a timeline in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Timeline of cash flows with uncertainty The present value \\(PV\\) is the sum of a number of discrete random variables that we can express as \\[ \\begin{array}{l} PV = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} v^k ~_kC~_kB~ .\\\\ \\end{array} \\tag{3.2} \\] There is no harm in letting the upper limit of the sum be infinity although for our applications it will be typically limited to a finite sum by contractual provisions in \\(~_kC\\) or human mortality through \\(_kB\\). 3.1.1 Moment Calculations Because \\(PV\\) is a random variable, we are able to summarize certain aspects of its distribution by calculating moments such as the mean and variance. Given that \\(_kC\\) and \\(v^k\\) are known, we can calculate the expected present value as follows: \\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathrm{E}(PV) &amp;= \\mathrm{E} \\left[ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} ~_kC~_kB~ v^k \\right] \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} ~_kC~ v^k ~\\Pr(_kB = 1) . \\end{array} } \\tag{3.3} \\] In this expression, we use the fact that the mean of a Bernoulli random variable equals the probability of being a one, that is, \\(\\mathrm{E}(_kB) = 0 \\times \\Pr(_kB = 1)\\) \\(+ 1 \\times \\Pr(_kB = 1) = \\Pr(_kB = 1)\\). The calculation in equation (3.3) does not depend on the dependence relationships among the \\(_kB\\) random variables; sums of expectations of random variables are not affected by correlations between random variables. Calculation of the variance of the present value does depend on the correlation among the cash flow indicators \\(_kB\\). For life contingent applications, we focus on three cases of interest: cash flow indicators are mutually independent, cash flow indicators are a function of the death of an individual, and cash flow indicators are a function of the survival of an individual. For the first situation, you can think of classic gambling situations where the outcome of one game does not affect another. This situation is of less interest to us but does serve as useful benchmark. In this case, the variance of the present value is \\[ \\mathrm{Var}(PV) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} ~_kC^2 ~v^{2k} ~\\Pr(_kB=1)[1-\\Pr(_kB=1)] . \\] In this expression, we use the fact that the variance of a Bernoulli random variable is \\(\\mathrm{Var}(_kB) = \\Pr(_kB = 1)[1-\\Pr(_kB=1)]\\). In the second case, cash flow indicators are a function of death in the period that can be represented by an indicator function \\(I(K_{\\bf{x}}=k)\\). Recall from Chapter 2 that we defined the random variable \\(K_{\\bf{x}}\\) as being the curtate death time (measured in years from the current time) for a life with set of attributes \\(\\bf{x}\\). In our models, death can occur at most one time (no necromancy) and so for example, \\(I(K_{\\bf{x}}=10)I(K_{\\bf{x}}=15) = 0\\), that is, death in the \\(10^{th}\\) period and the \\(15^{th}\\) period cannot both occur. This means that \\(_sB \\times ~_rB =0\\) for \\(r \\ne s\\) and \\[ \\begin{array}{l} PV^2 = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} v^{2k} ~_kC^2~_kB~, \\\\ \\end{array} \\] because all the cross-products are zero and an indicator variable squared is simply the indicator variable (\\(_kB^2 = ~_kB\\)). From this and the \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) \\(= \\mathrm{E}(PV^2) - [\\mathrm{E}(PV)]^2\\) formula, we have \\[ \\mathrm{Var}(PV) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} ~_kC^2 ~v^{2k} ~\\Pr(_kB=1) - [\\mathrm{E}(PV)]^2 . \\tag{3.4} \\] Single event cash flows typically occur when modeling life insurance benefits, the topic of Section 3.2. In the third case, cash flow indicators are a function of survival in the period that can be represented by an indicator function \\(I(K_{\\bf{x}} \\ge k)\\). In this case, cross-products are not zero but do take on a simple form. Think of a special case of both survival through the \\(10^{th}\\) period and through \\(15^{th}\\) period - this is the same as survival through the \\(15^{th}\\) period. Mathematically, we can write this as \\(I(K_{\\bf{x}}\\ge10)I(K_{\\bf{x}}\\ge15)\\) \\(= I(K_{\\bf{x}}\\ge15)\\). In general, we have \\(_sB \\times ~_rB = ~_rB\\) for \\(r \\ge s\\). With the present value of cash flows in equation (3.2) and a bit of algebra, we have \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} PV^2 &amp;= \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} v^r ~_rC ~_rB~\\right)^2 \\\\ &amp;= ~_0C^2 ~_0B + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} ~_kIC ~_kB , \\\\ \\text{where} \\\\ &amp; _kIC = v^{2k}~_kC^2+ 2v^{k} ~_kC \\sum_{s=0}^{k-1} v^{s} ~_sC . \\end{array} \\tag{3.5} \\] The strengths of the expression in display (3.5) are that it is sufficiently general to cover all of the life annuity applications in Section 3.3 and that is is easy to calculate recursively using a spreadsheet or via other numerical methods. The limitation is that it is difficult to interpret in this general form. To partially mitigate this last limitation, in the case of potential cash flows identically equal to one (\\(_kC=1\\)), one can write \\(~_kIC\\) \\(\\require{enclose}=v^{2k}+ 2v^{k} \\ddot{a}_{\\enclose{actuarial}{k}}\\).

Example 3.1. Ten Year Cash Flows of a Single Event. To illustrate, we consider ten years of cash flows at times \\(k \\in {0,1,2,\\ldots,10}\\). Cash flow amounts \\(_kC\\), one period spot rates \\(_k i\\), and probabilities of occurrence probability \\(\\Pr( _kB=1)\\) are given in Display 3.1. These inputs are highlighted (in yellow). This display shows the calculation of \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) for a cash flow model of the style shown in equations (3.2), (3.3) and (3.4), assuming that only one cash flow is possible. Input cells can be changed to see the impact on the \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) output, highlighted in orange. (The standard deviation, StDev, is provided as well). The component calculations of the summations in \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) can be found in Cells F3-F13 and G3-G13 respectively. To see the formulae for these cells just double click on the cell. You can download the file using the icon at the bottom right of the workbook. Display 3.1.

For life contingent benefits, the probabilities typically come from a survival model as described in Chapter 2. The unaccounted for 0.03 probability simply represents the event that person has lived beyond the ten year period; as there is no cash flow being made, there is no impact on the \\(PV\\) random variable. Appendix Section ?? provides additional examples of valuation of general cash flows under uncertainty. Our interest, however, is on cash flows from life contingent contracts. That is, the uncertainty of cash flows is governed by probabilities derived from the Chapter 2 lifetime models. 3.2 Life Insurance Benefits In this section, you learn how to: Express cash flow indicators for several life insurance benefits including whole life, term, pure endowment, and endowment contracts. Determine moments of each contract and interpret them using traditional actuarial notation in the special case of constant benefits. Calculate moments of each contract (using statistical software) and interpret differences due to varying policyholder and contract features. This section introduces some basic types of life insurance policies that have single cash payments triggered by an event, the death of the insured. Instead of the Bernoulli random variable \\(_{k+1}B\\), we now use \\(I(K_{\\bf{x}}=k)\\) to indicate payment in the \\(k+1\\)th period. That is, the random time of benefit payment is \\(K_{\\bf{x}}+1\\). The probability of this occurring is denoted as \\[ ~_{k|}q_{\\bf{x}} = \\Pr(K_{\\bf{x}}=k) \\] and, when \\(x\\) is a single age, we can write this as \\(~_{k|}q_{x} = ~_{k}p_{x} ~q_{x+k}\\). We find the random present value, its expectation, and the variance of the present value of the benefit cash flows of these policies using equations (3.2), (3.3), and (3.4). We also present standard notation that actuaries have developed for these calculations. This notation assumes that all cash flows \\(_kC\\) are \\(1\\) for simplification. Also, unless otherwise noted, we assume that benefits are paid at the end of the year. 3.2.1 Whole of life insurance Under a whole of life policy the insurer pays a benefit because of the death of the policyholder, with payment made at the end of the year of death. This system is illustrated on a timeline in Figure 3.2, with the \\(PV\\), \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) of the benefit cash flows shown in display (3.7). Since the cash flow is contingent on the death of the policyholder only one payment can be made and hence the calculation of \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) from equation (3.4) is valid. Figure 3.2: Timeline of benefit cash flows from a whole of life insurance policy We summarize the random variable, mean and variance as follows: \\[ \\require{enclose} \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{rcccccc} PV &amp;=&amp; v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} v^{k+1} ~I(K_{\\bf{x}}=k) \\\\ \\mathrm{E}(PV) &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} v^{k+1} ~_{k|}q_{\\bf{x}} &amp;=&amp; A_{\\bf{x}}\\\\ \\mathrm{Var}(PV) &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left( v^{k+1} \\right)^2 ~_{k|}q_{\\bf{x}} - [\\mathrm{E}(PV)]^2 &amp;=&amp; ~^2A_{\\bf{x}} - \\left( A_{\\bf{x}} \\right) ^2 .\\\\ \\end{array} } \\tag{3.7} \\] This display introduces the actuarial symbols \\(A_{\\bf{x}}\\) and \\(^2A_{\\bf{x}}\\). Here, \\(A_{\\bf{x}}\\) represents the expected present value of the benefits from a whole of life policy on \\(\\bf{x}\\). Similarly, \\(^2A_{\\bf{x}}\\) represents the expected squared present value of the benefits from the same whole of life policy and is used for calculating the variance of the present value. Life insurance actuarial symbols are summarized in Appendix Section 6.1.2. Example 3.2. Life Insurance by Selected Attributes. To illustrate, consider the Section 2.6 mortality. As a baseline, we consider a healthy female that is not a smoker, not obese, and has an average blood pressure level equal to 114 as well as an interest rate of 4%. Figure 3.3 summarizes the expected presented values \\(A_x\\) by age \\(x\\). The left-hand panel shows expected presented values \\(A_x\\) by age and gender where the blue solid line represents males and the dark red dashed line represents females. Not surprisingly, values of \\(A_x\\) vary by age \\(x\\). Also, for many ages, there are important differences between male and female values. Women tend to enjoy lower mortality rates and so have lower values of \\(A_x\\). The right-hand panel gives similar information by smoking status where the blue solid line represents smokers and the dark red dashed line represents nonsmokers. Not surprisingly, smokers have higher mortality and so have higher values of \\(A_x\\). Figure 3.3: Life Insurance by Age, Gender, and Smoking Status. Both panels show expected presented values \\(A_x\\) by age \\(x\\). For the left-hand panel, males are shown as solid blue, females as dark red dashed. For the right-hand panel, smokers are shown as solid blue, nonsmokers as dark red dashed. In the same way, Figure 3.4 shows the relationship between \\(A_x\\) and \\(x\\) for different blood pressure levels. Here, blood pressure ranges from 110 (the lowest line) to 170 (the highest line). From the figure, we see that blood pressure becomes increasingly important as \\(x\\) increases. Figure 3.4: Life Insurance by Age and Plood Pressure. A plot of expected presented values \\(A_x\\) by age \\(x\\). The lower thick line represents the lowest level of blood pressure, the upper line represents the highest level of blood pressure. 3.2.2 Term insurance Under a term insurance policy the insurer pays a benefit because of the death of the policyholder within a specified term \\(n\\) of the policy, with payment made at the end of the year of death. Hence, like whole of life insurance, the payment is made at time \\(K_{\\bf{x}}+1\\), as long as \\(K_{\\bf{x}}+1\\) is less than or equal to the \\(n\\) year term of the policy. This system is illustrated on a timeline in Figure 3.5, with the \\(PV\\), \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) of the benefit cash flows shown in display (3.8). Because the cash flow is contingent on the death of the policyholder, only one payment can be made and hence the calculation of \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) from equation (3.4) is valid. Figure 3.5: Timeline of benefit cash flows from a term insurance policy \\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{rl} PV &amp;= v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1} I(K_{\\bf{x}}+1 \\le n) = \\left \\{\\begin{array}{cl} v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1} &amp; \\text{where } K_{\\bf{x}}+1 \\le n \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{where } K_{\\bf{x}}+1 &gt; n \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} v^{k+1} ~I(K_{\\bf{x}}=k) \\\\ \\mathrm{E}(PV) &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} v^{k+1} ~_{k|}q_{\\bf{x}} = A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {1}\\\\ \\mathrm{Var}(PV) &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\left( v^{k+1} \\right)^2 ~_{k|}q_{\\bf{x}} - [\\mathrm{E}(PV)]^2 = ~^2A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {1} - \\left( A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {1} \\right)^2 . \\\\ \\end{array} } \\tag{3.8} \\] Display (3.8) introduces the actuarial symbols \\(A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {1}\\) and \\(^2A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {1}\\). Here, \\(A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {1}\\) represents the expected present value of the benefits from a term insurance policy on \\(\\bf{x}\\) of term \\(n\\) years. Similarly, \\(^2A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {1}\\) represents the expected squared present value of the benefits from the same term insurance policy. It is used for calculating the variance of the present value as per equation (3.2). Example 3.3. Term Life Insurance. Consider again the baseline case from Example 3.2, a healthy female that is not a smoker, not obese, and has an average blood pressure level equal to 114 as well as an interest rate of 4%. Figure 3.6 summarizes the expected presented values \\(A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {1}\\) by age \\(x\\) and selected values of the term, \\(n\\). It is not surprising that the effect of term limits diminishes as age increases. Differences among expected present values are most pronounced for the younger ages. Figure 3.6: Term Life Insurance by Age and Term. A plot of expected presented values \\(A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {1}\\) by age \\(x\\) for selected values of the term \\(n\\). 3.2.3 Pure endowment Under a pure endowment policy the insurer pays a benefit because of the survival of the policyholder for the \\(n\\) year term of the policy. In Chapter 2 we defined the random variable \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\) as being the exact death time (measured in years from the current time) of \\(\\bf{x}\\). The time of the benefit payment is \\(n\\) but is dependent upon \\(T_{\\bf{x}}\\). This system is illustrated on a timeline in Figure 3.7, with the \\(PV\\), \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) of the benefit cash flows shown in display (3.9). Since the cash flow is contingent on the death of the policyholder only one payment can be made and hence the calculation of \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) from equation (3.4) is valid. Figure 3.7: Timeline of benefit cash flows from a pure endowment policy \\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{rll} PV &amp;= v^n I(T_{\\bf{x}}&gt;n) &amp;= \\left \\{\\begin{array}{cl} 0 &amp; \\text{where } T_{\\bf{x}} \\le n \\\\ v^n &amp; \\text{where } T_{\\bf{x}} &gt; n \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\\\ \\mathrm{E}(PV) &amp;= v^n {_np_{\\bf{x}}} &amp;= A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {\\space \\space \\space \\space \\space 1} \\\\ \\mathrm{Var}(PV) &amp;= v^{2n} {_np_{\\bf{x}}}(1-{_np_{\\bf{x}}}) . \\end{array} } \\tag{3.9} \\] This display introduces the actuarial symbol \\(A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {\\space \\space \\space \\space \\space 1}\\). Here, \\(A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {\\space \\space \\space \\space \\space 1}\\) represents the expected present value of the benefits from a pure endowment policy on \\(\\bf{x}\\) of term \\(n\\) years. Unlike whole of life and term insurance we do not define notation for the expected squared present value of the benefits from the same pure endowment policy as the variance of the present value is simple to express without it, since the \\(PV\\) is effectively \\(v^n\\) multiplied by a Bernoulli random variable with parameter \\({_np_{\\bf{x}}}\\). 3.2.4 Endowment insurance An endowment insurance policy is effectively a combination of a term insurance and pure endowment policy. The insurer pays a benefit at the end of the year of death if the policyholders death occurs within the term \\(n\\) of the policy, or at time \\(n\\) if the policyholder survives until the term \\(n\\). This system can be illustrated on a timeline as can be seen in Figure 3.8, with the \\(PV\\), \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) of the benefit cash flows shown in display (3.10). Since the cash flow is contingent on the death of the policyholder only one payment can be made and hence the calculation of \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\) from equation (3.4) is valid.

Similarly, \\(^2A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\\) represents the expected squared present value of the benefits from the same endowment insurance policy and is used for calculating the variance of the present value as per equation (3.2). 3.3 Life Annuity Benefits In this section, you learn how to: Express cash flow indicators for several life annuity benefits including life, term life, deferred life, and guaranteed life contracts. Determine moments of each contract and interpret them using traditional actuarial notation in the special case of constant benefits. Calculate moments of each contract (using statistical software) and interpret differences due to varying policyholder and contract features. This section introduces several basic types of life annuity policies. As with Section 3.2, this notation assumes that all cash flows \\(_kC\\) are \\(1\\) for simplification. Life annuity actuarial symbols are summarized in Appendix Section 6.1.3. 3.3.1 Life annuity Under a life annuity policy the insurer pays regular benefits to policyholders whilst they are alive. An annuity payable in advance has benefits paid at the start of the year, while an annuity payable in arrears has benefits paid at the end of the year. This system is illustrated on a timeline in Figure 3.9. Figure 3.9: Timeline of benefit cash flows from a life annuity policy The following displays summarize the \\(PV\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) of the benefit cash flows. For payments in advance, we have: \\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{rl} PV &amp;= 1+v^{1}+v^{2}+ \\cdots +v^{K_{\\bf{x}}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{K_{\\bf{x}}} v^k \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} v^{k} ~I(K_{\\bf{x}} \\ge k) \\\\ \\mathrm{E}(PV) &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} v^{k} ~_kp_{\\bf{x}} = \\ddot{a}_{\\bf{x}} .\\\\ \\end{array} } \\tag{3.11} \\] For payments in arrears, we have: \\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{rl} PV &amp;= v^{1}+v^{2}+ \\cdots +v^{K_{\\bf{x}}} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} v^{k+1} ~I(K_{\\bf{x}} \\ge k+1) \\\\ \\mathrm{E}(PV) &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} v^{k+1} ~_{k+1}p_{\\bf{x}} = {a}_{\\bf{x}} = \\ddot{a}_{\\bf{x}} - 1 .\\\\ \\end{array} } \\tag{3.12} \\] These displays introduce the actuarial symbols \\(\\ddot{a}_{\\bf{x}}\\) and \\({a}_{\\bf{x}}\\). Here, \\(\\ddot{a}_{\\bf{x}}\\) and \\({a}_{\\bf{x}}\\) represent the expected present value of the benefits from a life annuity policy on \\(\\bf{x}\\), in advance and in arrears respectively. The variance of present values can be calculated using the general expression in equation (3.6) with, in this special case, \\(~_kIC\\) \\(\\require{enclose}=v^{2k}+ 2v^{k} \\ddot{a}_{\\enclose{actuarial}{k}}\\). A special case of interest occurs when the yield curve is flat so that \\(_ki=i\\). Then, the \\(PV\\) in equations (3.9) and (3.10) above can also be expressed using actuarial notation from financial mathematics. For example, for a life annuity in advance: \\[ PV =1+v^{1}+v^{2}+\\cdots +v^{K_{\\bf{x}}} \\space = \\ddot{a}_{\\enclose{actuarial}{K_{\\bf{x}}+1}} = \\frac{1+i}{i} \\left( 1-v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1} \\right) . \\tag{3.13} \\] Remember that the present value of benefits from a whole of life policy is equal to \\(v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1}\\). Therefore this relationship can be used to examine a relationship between life annuities and whole of life policies, starting from the \\(PV\\) of a life annuity in advance as follows: \\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{rcccccccc} PV &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1+i}{i} \\left( 1-v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1} \\right) \\\\ \\mathrm{E}(PV) &amp;=&amp; \\mathrm{E} \\left[ \\frac{1+i}{i} \\left(1-v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1} \\right) \\right] &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1+i}{i} \\left(1- \\mathrm{E} \\left[ v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1} \\right] \\right) \\\\ \\ddot{a}_{\\bf{x}} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1+i}{i} \\left(1- A_{\\bf{x}} \\right) \\\\ \\mathrm{Var}(PV) &amp;=&amp; \\mathrm{Var} \\left[ \\frac{1+i}{i} \\left(1-v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1} \\right) \\right] \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\left( \\frac{1+i}{i} \\right) ^2 \\mathrm{Var} \\left[ v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1} \\right] &amp;=&amp; \\left( \\frac{1+i}{i} \\right) ^2 \\left( ~^2A_{\\bf{x}} - \\left( A_{\\bf{x}} \\right) ^2 \\right) . \\end{array} } \\tag{3.14} \\] The relationships in equations (3.13) and (3.14) hold only when \\(_ki = i\\), but do provide an intuitive calculation of the variance of the present value of a life annuity. However, the restrictive assumption of a flat yield curve makes this relationship less useful in practice and so we will not consider it in further detail. Example 3.4. Life Annuities by Age, Interest Rate, and Gender. To illustrate, we return to the insurance mortality used in Example 3.2. Figure 3.10 summarizes the expected presented values \\(\\ddot{a}_x\\) by age, interest rate, and gender. As with insurances, for many ages, there are important differences between male and female values. Because women tend to enjoy lower mortality rates, they have higher values of \\(\\ddot{a}_x\\). Not surprisingly, values of \\(\\ddot{a}_x\\) vary by age \\(x\\) and interest rate \\(i\\). The figure emphasizes that the interest rate produces greater differences in \\(\\ddot{a}_x\\) for younger ages than older ages. Figure 3.10: Life Annuities by Age, Interest Rate, and Gender. Male annuities are in the left-hand panel, those for females are in the right. For both panels, each line corresponds to an interest rates with the top line being \\(i=0\\) and the bottom line being \\(i=0.06\\). Figure 3.10a. Interactive Version of Figure 3.10. Use the mouse to rotate the figure to see different perspectives. One can use this plot to motivate a type of multiplicative effect that an interest rate and age has on an annuity value. 3.3.2 Term life annuity Under a term life annuity policy the insurer pays benefits to policyholders whilst they are alive, for a maximum of \\(n\\) periods. For annuities in advance and in arrears, this system is illustrated on a timeline in Figure 3.11, with the \\(PV\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) of the benefit cash flows shown in displays (3.15) and (3.16).

The variance of present values can be calculated using the general expressions in equations (3.5) and (3.6). 3.3.3 Deferred life annuity Under a deferred life annuity policy the insurer pays benefits to policyholders whilst they are alive, but only after a deferral period of \\(n\\) periods. For annuities in advance and in arrears, this system is illustrated on a timeline in Figure 3.12, with the \\(PV\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) of the benefit cash flows shown in displays (3.17) and (3.18).

Here, \\(_{n|}\\ddot{a}_{\\bf{x}}\\) and \\(_{n|}{a}_{\\bf{x}}\\) represent the expected present value of the benefits from a deferred life annuity policy on \\(\\bf{x}\\), in advance and in arrears respectively. 3.3.4 Guaranteed life annuity A guaranteed life annuity policy is the same as a life annuity policy, except that the benefits are guaranteed to be paid for a minimum of \\(n\\) periods. For annuities in advance and in arrears, this system is illustrated on a timeline in Figure 3.13, with the \\(PV\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) of the benefit cash flows shown in displays (3.19) and (3.20). Figure 3.13: Timeline of benefit cash flows from a guaranteed life annuity policy In advance: \\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{rl} PV &amp;= 1+v^{1}+v^{2}+ \\cdots +v^{\\text{max}[K_{\\bf{x}},n-1]} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} v^{k} + \\sum_{k=n}^{\\infty} v^{k} ~I(K_{\\bf{x}} \\ge k) \\\\ \\mathrm{E}(PV) &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} v^k + \\sum_{k=n}^{\\infty} v^k ~_kp_{\\bf{x}} = \\ddot{a}_{\\overline{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}}} = \\ddot{a}_{\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + ~_{n|}\\ddot{a}_{\\bf{x}} .\\\\ \\end{array} } \\tag{3.19} \\] In arrears: \\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{rl} PV &amp;= v^{1}+v^{2}+ \\cdots +v^{\\text{max}[K_{\\bf{x}},n]} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} v^{k+1} + \\sum_{k=n}^{\\infty} v^{k+1} ~I(K_{\\bf{x}} \\ge k+1) \\\\ \\mathrm{E}(PV) &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} v^{k+1} + \\sum_{k=n}^{\\infty} v^{k+1} ~_{k+1}p_{\\bf{x}} = {a}_{\\overline{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}}} = {a}_{\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + ~_{n|}{a}_{\\bf{x}} .\\\\ \\end{array} } \\tag{3.20} \\] These displays introduce the actuarial symbols \\(\\ddot{a}_{\\overline{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}}}\\) and \\({a}_{\\overline{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}}}\\).

Traditional approaches to valuing life insurances and life annuities, presented in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 respectively, emphasize constant cash amounts (taken to be one without loss of generality) and constant rates of interest. Although important, there are also many instances where cash benefits and interest rates vary over time. An advantage of a spreadsheet or a flexible programming approach is that there are no important restrictions on the cash flows nor interest rates, as long as they are known in advance. The structure presented in Section 3.1 readily accommodates these extensions. So, to see how they might work in practice, in this section we show the important calculations using a spreadsheet approach. That is, the calculations are performed in a spreadsheet in such a way to allow flexibility to adjust age (\\(x\\)), term (\\(n\\)), cash flows (\\(_kC\\)), interest rates (\\(_ki\\)) and life table mortality rates (\\(q_x\\)). Display 3.2 shows a workbook that can be viewed and downloaded. Display 3.2. Spreadsheet Calculations of Life Contingent Benefits There are three tabs in the Display 3.2 worksheet. Initially appearing is the third tab called Assum &amp; Outp - var C that contains calculations and results, allowing for a variable \\(_kC\\). The calculations are performed using the first principles of equations (3.2), (3.3) and (3.4). Cells highlighted in yellow can be changed to adjust \\(x\\), \\(n\\), \\(_kC\\) and \\(_ki\\). Cells highlighted in orange provide the output calculations for the benefits described in Section 3.2. Similar timing conventions are adopted to that of the previous worksheet, with the cash flows occurring at the beginning (\\(k\\)) or end (\\(k+1\\)) of the year. The first tab, denoted as Life Table, contains yellow highlighted \\(q_x\\) cells can be adjusted as desired. The second tab, denoted as Assum &amp; Outp - fixed C, contains calculations and results, assuming that \\(_kC\\) equals a fixed \\(C\\). This allows the use of the notation introduced in Section 3.2. Cells highlighted in yellow can be changed to adjust \\(x\\), \\(n\\), \\(C\\) and \\(_ki\\). Cells highlighted in orange provide the output calculations for the benefits described in Section 3.2. In this and the next worksheet a column Year is introduced which is equal to \\(k+1\\). The column is introduced so that we may think of the cash flows as related to a profit year for an insurer, which we will introduce in Chapter X. Various calculation columns for both \\(k\\) and \\(k+1\\) are calculated, to account for cash flows occurring at the beginning of the year (e.g. life annuities in advance) and cash flows occurring at the end of a year (e.g. life annuities in arrears) whilst still allocating these cash flows to the same year. You are recommended to review the formulae in the workbook against those found in Section 3.1 and 3.2, to confirm your understanding of how to perform the calculations in a spreadsheet package. The calculations are not performed in R, although a case study using R will be provided in Section 3.5. 3.5 Case Study: A Portfolio of Term Insurance Policies In this section, you learn how to: Determine the distribution of the present value of an insurance contract using statistical software. Summarize the moments of a portfolio of contracts. Determine the distribution of a portfolio of contracts, using simulation as well as a normal approximation. Now let us consider a collection, or portfolio, of several contracts. For simplicity, we assume that all contracts are of the term insurance type introduced in Section 3.2.2. We do allow contract policyholders to have different ages and gender as well as choosing different contract terms and amounts insured. For notation, we use the subscript \\(j\\) to differentiate among contracts and so denote individual features as \\({\\bf{x}}_j\\) where \\(j = 1,2, \\ldots,J\\) using \\(J\\) for the number of contracts. We constructed a portfolio that mimics others that we have seen in practice. We assume that policyholders from the final year of the insurer data (i.e. Month 780) purchase a term insurance policy, giving us \\(J=190\\). The policyholder data can be obtained by clicking on this link. For illustrative purposes, we assume that mortality follows that described in Example 3.2. For these data, it turns out that there 136 females and 54 males in the portfolio. Figure 3.14 summarizes the distributions of initial ages, contract terms, and sums insured.

Specifically, we consider a healthy female aged \\(x=50\\) at the purchase of the policy with mortality described in Example 3.3. To demonstrate the flexibility of these methods, unlike this example, for discounting we use the spot rates specified in Display 3.2. Further we assume this individual has purchased a term insurance policy with term \\(n=10\\) years with a sum insured of $400,000 (\\(=~_kC\\)) and that we wish to value the policy immediately after purchase. As we did in Section 3.4, we can begin the valuation calculations of \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)\\), based on the results from display (3.8), using a spreadsheet. Display 3.3. Valuation of an individual policy Display 3.3 summarizes the results where we see that the expected present value for this policy is 13,981. The display also shows the variance and, after taking a square root, we see that the standard deviation is 67,637. As we will learn in Chapter 5, expected present values are good approximations for a policy premium and so are easy to interpret. In contrast, it is difficult to interpret the standard deviation for a single contract. However, single contract standard deviations are important ingredients that are used to build variances and standard deviations for portfolios that are meaningful quantities. The following R code can be used to perform the same calculations as in Display 3.3. R Code For Term Insurance Individual Example Year &lt;- c(1:10) CashFlow &lt;- 400000 SpotRate &lt;- 0.02 vk &lt;- (1+SpotRate)^(-Year) qx &lt;- c(0.002360318, 0.002652652, 0.002981138, 0.003350234, 0.003764941, 0.004230873, 0.00475433, 0.005342376, 0.006002936, 0.006744893) kpx &lt;- numeric(length(Year)) # Initialising probability of survival to be used in the loop below qxdef &lt;- numeric(length(Year)) # Initialising deferred probability of death to be used in the loop below kpx[1] &lt;- 1 qxdef[1] &lt;- kpx[1]*qx[1] for(i in 2:length(Year)){ # Calculates probability of survival and deferred probability of death for future years kpx[i] &lt;- kpx[i-1]*(1-qx[i-1]) qxdef[i]&lt;-kpx[i]*qx[i] } # Expected Present Value calculation EPV &lt;- sum(CashFlow*vk*qxdef) EPV # Standard Deviation of Present Value calculation CashFlowSq &lt;- CashFlow^2 vkSq &lt;- vk^2 VarPV &lt;- sum(CashFlowSq*vkSq*qxdef)-EPV^2 VarPV StDevPV &lt;- sqrt(VarPV) StDevPV [1] 14609 [1] 4957467035 [1] 70409 Distribution of Present Values. Another way of analysing the random present value \\(PV\\) is to investigate its distribution. From display (3.8), we see that \\(PV\\) is a function of the random \\(K_{\\bf{x}}\\), a discrete random variable. Thus, \\(PV\\) is also discrete. We can use knowledge of the probability mass function (pmf) of \\(K_{\\bf{x}}\\), \\(\\Pr(K_{\\bf{x}}=k) = ~_{k|}q_{\\bf{x}}\\), to determine the pmf of \\(PV\\). In this example we denote \\(~_kPV = 400,000v^{k+1}\\) for \\(k \\in \\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots,9\\}\\) and \\(~_kPV = 0\\) otherwise. Therefore the probability mass function of \\(PV\\) is \\(\\Pr \\left( PV= ~_kPV \\right) = ~_{k|}q_{49}\\) where \\(k \\in \\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots,9\\}\\) and \\(\\Pr \\left( PV= 0 \\right) = ~_{10}p_{49}\\). These values are: R Code for pmf calculation npx &lt;- kpx[10]*(1-qx[10]) PV &lt;- CashFlow*(1+SpotRate)^(-Year) PV[11] &lt;- 0 #PVout &lt;- round(PV,digits = 2) PVout &lt;- formatC(as.numeric(PV),format=&quot;f&quot;,digits=0) Probs &lt;- c(qxdef,npx) Probsout &lt;- round(Probs,digits = 4) ProbsoutMat &lt;- t(cbind(PVout, Probsout)) rownames(ProbsoutMat) &lt;- c(&quot;kPV&quot;, &quot;Pr(PV = kPV)&quot;) colnames(ProbsoutMat) &lt;- rep(&quot;&quot;,11) knitr::kable(ProbsoutMat, align=&quot;r&quot;) kPV 392157 384468 376929 369538 362292 355189 348224 341396 334702 328139 0 Pr(PV = kPV) 0.0024 0.0026 0.003 0.0033 0.0037 0.0042 0.0047 0.0052 0.0058 0.0065 0.9586 Note the large proportion of the distribution at \\(PV=0\\) (over 95% for this example). This is common in life insurance applications. Among other things, this means that the distribution is not even approximately normal and so specialized techniques are required to summarize the distribution. Nonetheless, as we see in the following subsections, the distribution of a portfolio of policies may well be approximately normally distributed. 3.5.2 Moments of a portfolio of policies We now return to the portfolio of \\(J=190\\) policies. Using display (3.8), the present value for the \\(j\\)th policy is \\[ PV_j = v^{K_{{\\bf{x}}_j}+1} I(K_{{\\bf{x}}_j}+1 \\le n_j) . \\] Using display (3.8) and incorporating the variable sum insured \\(C_j\\) and term \\(n_j\\), for this portfolio we can describe the present value, its expectation, and variance as: \\[ \\boxed{ \\begin{array}{rl} PV &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^J PV_j \\\\ \\mathrm{E}(PV) &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^J \\mathrm{E}(PV_j) = \\sum_{j=1}^J C_j \\left \\{\\sum_{k=0}^{n_j-1} v^{k+1} ~_k|q_{{\\bf{x}}_j} \\right\\} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^J C_j ~ A_{{\\bf{x}_j}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n_j}} ^ {1} \\\\ \\mathrm{Var}(PV) &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^J \\left\\{\\mathrm{E}(PV_j^2) - [\\mathrm{E}(PV_j)]^2 \\right\\} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^J C_j^2 \\left\\{ ~ ~^2A_{{\\bf{x}_j}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n_j}} ^ {1} - [ ~ A_{{\\bf{x}_j}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n_j}} ^ {1} ]^2 \\right\\}.\\\\ \\end{array} } \\tag{3.21} \\] We can calculate the portfolio mean and standard deviation using display (3.21). It turns out that the expected portfolio value is 5516 and the standard deviation is 1290, both in thousands of dollars. This is done in the following R code.

In many actuarial applications, it is common to encounter situations far too complex to analyze analytically. Typically, in actuarial practice one turns to simulation of results. For one introduction to simulation, see the chapter in the open textbook Loss Data Analytics on Simulation and Resampling. For this portfolio, even if the insured policyholders are independent across all \\(j\\), determining the exact distribution of \\(PV\\) is typically not possible. Instead we use simulation to gain a greater understanding of the distribution of \\(PV\\). The following code shows the output of 500 simulated observations of \\(PV\\) from equation (3.21), including the mean, standard deviation and a histogram.

Despite the extreme skewness of the \\(PV\\) outcomes for an individual policyholder, the distribution of the \\(PV\\) of the portfolio of policies is remarkably bell shaped. This is evidence of the Central Limit Theorem in action. Whilst the standard deviation of the \\(PV\\) of an individual policy is many times larger than the \\(E(PV)\\), the standard deviation of the \\(PV\\) of a portfolio of policies is multiple times smaller than the \\(E(PV)\\). From both of the observations, we learn that the standard deviation (and variance) is helpful in understanding the uncertainty of a portfolio. This is despite our observation in the case of a single policy where we saw that the standard deviation was not helpful because of the large mass at zero of the distribution. We will revisit this point again in later chapters when investigating the financial condition of a life insurer. 3.6 Further Resources and Contributors Contributors Adam Butt, Australian National University, and Edward (Jed) Frees, University of Wisconsin-Madison &amp; Australian National University, are the principal authors of the initial version of this chapter.

The above is written assuming a primer somewhere before this chapter including basic interest theory, as per the draft book structure (and my comments) from November 2020. Notation discussion. Id like to keep \\(PV\\) as we can use it for all types of present value calculations (insurance benefits, annuity benefits, premiums, etc.). Id like to keep \\(V\\) for reserves. We also need to think about consistency of terminology: do we use actuarial present value or expected present value? Is it necessary to emphasize distinction? (I deliberately havent). Jeds initial principles suggest uppercase italics for random variables. Thats OK as long as we are recognising that sometimes the values wont be random if all elements of the RHS of the equation are deterministic. Further, elements such as \\(C\\) might be random variables in some types of policies (e.g. unit linked) but not others. Keeping benefit cashflows as \\(C\\) works and we can use \\(P\\) for premium cash flows. Having \\(t\\) be a left subscript ensures that right subscripts are reserved for individual characteristics \\({\\bf{x}}_j.\\) It leaves open the possibility of employing \\(_tC_{{\\bf{x}}_j}\\) or \\(_tC_j\\) where relevant for a policy that is specific to an individual.

Structure discussion.Im not sure how much of these sorts of notation and probability calculations will be in Chapter 2 and whether well need more basic probability calculations before this. It may make sense to have another chapter between Chapter 2 and this that focused on the life table and the various probability calculations coming from the life table  DHW do some of this in their Chapter 3 and incorporate things like mortality improvement and selection there as well. Promislow also does it in his Chapter 3. Valuing benefits using actuarial notation We finish Chapter 3.2 with a brief description of how to use actuarial notation to value life contingent benefits. The example is provided in the context of whole of life policy with a fixed sum insured \\(_kC = C\\). We can define the random variable of the present value of the benefits of this policy as \\(Cv^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1}\\) and hence \\(\\mathrm{E}(PV)=C\\mathrm{E} \\left[ v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1} \\right] = CA_{\\bf{x}}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}(PV)=C^2\\mathrm{Var} \\left[ v^{K_{\\bf{x}}+1} \\right]\\) \\(= C^2 \\left( ~^2A_{\\bf{x}} - \\left( A_{\\bf{x}} \\right) ^2 \\right).\\) Note for author to complete. We could show additional relationships among the different policies, including recursion (see DHW Chapter 5), perhaps as exercises for students. Some of this might better fit a chapter on reserves. Need to decide this. Need to think about exercises here. Note for author to complete. There are many exercises and examples that could follow on from this which will need to be considered. I also need to update the actuarial notation in a spreadsheet (the cells highlighted green) To be resolved later. Other important concepts to address in this or another chapter: - The relationship between life insurance and life annuities. The two are perfect natural hedge provided mortality is the same. If life policies mortality are different from annuitant mortality, the relationship breaks down. My instinct is that this goes in a later chapter. - The concept of discounting with life using pure endowment. - The recursive formula for the value from year to year - probably later as part of policy values.

This chapter provide extensions and variations to exhibit the richness of applications. Specifically, Section 4.1 presents a relatively minor extension theoretically, allowing for \\(m^{th}\\)ly cash flows, that has extensive practical ramifications for retirement benefits, other life contingent annuities, and premium payment plans. Section 4.2 sharpens our intuition about survival modeling by linking the choice of a survival dataset to an application under consideration; when the link is not appropriate, important biases can arise. Section 4.3 provides economic motivation for some of the measures summarizing insurance features introduced in Chapter 3; this motivation provides insights as why some of these are so important in practice. Through a variety of examples, Section 4.4 emphasizes that the framework for life contingent benefits applies to contingent payment problems that go beyond applications restricted to the life insurance industry. 4.1 Contingent Cash Flows Occurring \\(m^{th}\\)ly This section extends Chapter 3 by considering cases where cash flows occur more frequently than once a year. For example, it is common for retirement benefits to be paid on a monthly basis while a person is alive. As another example, premiums might be paid twice a year, as long as the policyholder is alive and the contract is in force. We use \\(m\\) to denote the number of payments per year. For the retirement benefits example, we would use \\(m=12\\) and for premiums, \\(m=2\\). Other common examples are \\(m=4\\) for quarterly cash flows, \\(m=52\\) for weekly, and so forth. We will even consider the case where the number of payments becomes arbitrarily large, \\(m \\to \\infty\\), corresponding to a cash flow at the moment an event such as death occurs. When describing benefits paid discretely, we started in Chapter 3 with annual payments because mortality tables have traditionally been presented on an integer age basis. In addition, business requirements such as insurance company financial reporting is done routinely on an annual basis. Nonetheless, as described above, there are also important situations where payments occur than annually (typically more frequently, although payments once every, e.g., two years are certainly plausible). 4.1.1 Basic Concepts To appreciate the concerns when transiting from an annual to an \\(m^{th}\\)ly basis, here is a modified version of Figure 3.1. Figure 4.1: Timeline of \\(m^{th}\\)ly cash flows with uncertainty Similar to equation (3.2), the present value \\(PV\\) random variable can be summarized as \\[ \\begin{array}{l} PV = \\sum_{r=0}^{\\infty} v^{r/m} ~_{r/m}C~_{r/m}B~ ~,\\\\ \\end{array} \\tag{4.1} \\] using \\(r\\) is a counter for the number of \\(m^{th}\\)ly units. For probabilities associated with the cash flow indicator, as we saw in Chapter 3, we are concerned with payments either at the death or the survival of a policyholder age \\(x\\). That is, \\[ \\mathrm{E} \\left(_{r/m}B\\right) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc} \\Pr\\left(\\frac{r-1}{m} &lt; T_x \\le \\frac{r}{m}\\right) &amp; = &amp; ~_{(r-1)/m} p_x - ~_{r/m} p_x&amp; {\\small \\text{ prob of death}} \\\\ \\Pr\\left(T_x \\ge \\frac{r}{m}\\right) &amp; =&amp; ~_{r/m} p_x &amp; {\\small \\text{ prob of survival} }.\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\tag{4.2} \\] As many readers will recall from their study of interest theory, if we think of a discount factor \\(v^t = (1 + ~_t i)^{-t}\\) in terms of a spot rate of interest \\(~_t i\\), then there is no difficulty at all in discounting at non-integer times. In addition, suppose that the survival model can be expressed in terms of continuous time, such as the analytic laws of mortality in Section 2.3 or their extended versions in Section 2.6. In these cases, thinking of the unit of time as a year is a mere convenience and no additional theoretical extensions are required for handling \\(m^{th}\\)ly cash flows. Uniform Distribution of Deaths. Only in the case where we have annual mortality with \\(m^{th}\\)ly cash flows are some extensions required. And we already started on this in Section 2.4.4 where fractional year assumptions were introduced. To see how this works with \\(m^{th}\\)ly cash flows, we use the uniform distribution of death (UDD) assumption so that we can express \\(~_t p_x = 1 - t \\times q_x\\), for \\(0 \\le t \\le 1\\). Thus, using \\(j\\) is a counter for the number of \\(m^{th}\\)ly units within a year, we have \\[ ~_{j/m} p_x = 1- \\frac{j}{m} \\times q_x, \\ \\ \\text{for } j= 0, 1, \\ldots, m-1. \\] For integer \\(k=0, 1, \\dots\\) \\[ ~_{k+j/m} p_x = ~_k p_x \\times ~_{j/m} p_{x+k}= ~_k p_x \\times \\left(1- \\frac{j}{m} \\times q_{x+k}\\right). \\] Here, to calculate the probability of a life aged \\(x\\) surviving \\(k+j/m\\) years, we first calculated the probability of surviving \\(k\\) (integer) years and then, conditional on having attained age \\(x+k\\), applied the UDD assumption to calculate the probability of surviving an additional \\(j/m\\) fraction of a year. These expressions, together with equations (4.1) and (4.2), are enough to compute an expected present value for an \\(m^{th}\\)ly version of any of the Chapter 3 cash flows. 4.1.2 Illustrative Cash Flows Let us see how these ideas work with a few illustrative examples. To begin, we start by assuming that we have a continuous time probability model and so no simplifying assumptions are needed. Example 4.1. Whole Life Insurance with \\(m^{th}\\)ly Payments with Continuous Time Mortality. For this contract, the benefit is paid at the end of the \\(m^{th}\\)ly period in which death occurs. Let us return to the familiar Example 3.2 that used the Section 2.6 mortality. We consider the baseline case in Example 3.2 that you will recall is a healthy female who is not a smoker, not obese, and has an average blood pressure level equal to 114. The interest rate is a constant 4%. To calculate the expected value of this policy, we may use equations (4.1) and (4.2) directly with the potential cash flows identically equal to one \\(~_{k/m}C \\equiv 1\\). The resulting expected present value is \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} A_{{\\bf{x}}}^{(m)} &amp;= \\sum_{r=0}^{\\infty} ~v^{(r+1)/m} \\{ ~_{r/m} p_x - ~_{(r+1)/m} p_x \\} ,\\\\ \\end{array} \\] an expression that introduces the common actuarial notation for the expected present value of this contract. The superscript \\(~^{(m)}\\) denotes \\(m^{th}\\)ly cash flows. Figure 4.2 summarizes the expected presented values by age \\(x\\) over choices of \\(m=1,2,4, 12\\). As is evident from the plot, these values are close and in fact ordered as \\[ A_x = A_x^{(1)} \\le A_x^{(2)} \\le A_x^{(4)} \\le A_x^{(12)} ~. \\] The annual expected presented value, \\(A_x = A_x^{(1)}\\), is the smallest because it is the contract with payments potentially farthest in the future. For example, if a person dies just before one month into a contract year, then the payment is 11 months after death. In contrast, it is five months after death when \\(m=2\\), two months later for \\(m=4\\) and virtually instantaneous for \\(m=12\\). So, the very largest the separation that could be in Figure 4.2 is \\(1/(1+i) = 1/1.04 \\approx 0.96\\), suggesting that these expected present values will be close to one another. Figure 4.2: Life Insurance by \\(m^{th}\\)ly Payments. The dark red dashed represents expected present values based on annual cash flows with \\(m=1\\). The other lines are for \\(m=2, 4, 12\\), increasing in that order. Example 4.2. Whole Life Insurance with \\(m^{th}\\)ly Payments with Annual Mortality. Continuing Example 4.1, we no longer assume that a continuous time mortality model is available but we have only traditional life table mortality at integer (or annual) ages. To calculate the expected value of the policy, we follow the procedure of splitting up the payment stream into yearly intervals and then applying the UDD assumption within each year. The details follow. \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} A_{{\\bf{x}}}^{(m)} &amp;= \\sum_{r=0}^{\\infty} ~v^{(r+1)/m} \\{ ~_{r/m} p_x - ~_{(r+1)/m} p_x \\} \\\\ &amp;= \\ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} v^{k+(j+1)/m} \\{ ~_{k+j/m} p_x - ~_{k+(j+1)/m} p_x \\} \\\\ &amp;=_{UDD} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} ~_k p_x \\left\\{\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} v^{k+(j+1)/m} \\left( \\frac{1}{m} \\times q_{x+k}\\right) \\right\\} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} ~_k p_x ~q_{x+k} \\left\\{\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} v^{k+(j+1)/m} \\right\\} ~.\\\\ \\end{array} \\] To simplify the presentation, we further assume a constant spot rate \\(i\\) so that \\(v^t =(1+i)^{-t}\\). With this, we can employ standard geometric sums that many readers will recall from interest theory, \\[ \\frac{1+i}{m} v^{1/m}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} v^{j/m} = \\frac{1+i}{m}v^{1/m}\\frac{1-v}{1-v^{1/m}} = \\frac{i}{i^{(m)}} ~, \\\\ \\] where \\(i^{(m)} = m\\left[(1+i)^{1/m}-1\\right]\\) is the actuarial symbol for a \\(m^{th}\\)ly interest rate. This yields \\[ A_{{\\bf{x}}}^{(m)} = \\frac{i}{i^{(m)}} A_x ~. \\] This equation exhibits a constant relationship between the annual expected value of a whole life insurance and one on an \\(m^{th}\\)ly basis. Also from interest theory, a simple (Taylor series) approximation shows that \\(\\frac{i}{i^{(m)}} \\approx 1 + \\frac{i}{2}(1-\\frac{1}{m})\\), indicating the proximity between these expected present values. Example 4.3. Term Life Annuity with \\(m^{th}\\)ly Payments. For a more complex example, we now consider the case of an \\(n\\) year term life annuity with \\(m^{th}\\)ly payments in advance. By convention, when presenting actuarial annuity symbols, each payment (when the person is alive) is assumed to be \\(~_{r/m}C \\equiv 1/m\\), not 1. This is so that we can readily compare annuities with different payment plans, for example, quarterly to monthly payments, because they both pay a sum of 1 over the year if the annuitant survives. Based on equation (4.1), and similar to equation (3.15), the random present value of payments is \\(PV = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{r=0}^{nm-1} v^{r/m} ~I(T_{\\bf{x}} \\ge r/m)\\). With this and equation (4.2), the expected present value is \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} \\ddot{a}_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}}^{(m)} &amp;= \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\left\\{\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} v^{k+j/m} ~_{k+j/m}p_{\\bf{x}}\\right\\} \\\\ &amp;=_{UDD} \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ~_k p_x \\left\\{\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} v^{k+j/m} \\left(1- \\frac{j}{m} \\times q_{x+k}\\right) \\right\\} ~.\\\\ \\end{array} \\] To simplify the presentation, we again assume a constant spot rate \\(i\\) so that \\(v^t =(1+i)^{-t}\\). After some pleasant algebra, one can show that \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} \\ddot{a}_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}}^{(m)} &amp;=_{UDD} \\frac{d}{d^{(m)}} \\ddot{a}_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - v ~\\beta(m) A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {1} ~,\\\\ \\end{array} \\] where \\(d^{(m)} = m\\left[1- v^{1/m}\\right]\\) is an \\(m^{th}\\)ly discount factor and \\(\\beta(m) = \\frac{i-i^{(m)}}{i^{(m)}d^{(m)}}\\) is another factor based only on the interest rate, not the survival model. You can check, either using Taylor series approximations or by calculating using several values of \\(m\\) and \\(i\\), that \\(\\beta(m) \\approx \\frac{m-1}{2m}\\), an approximation that is very useful for interpreting this expected present value. Verify Development of EPV for Term Life Annuity with mthly Payments First recall some standard notation from interest theory: \\[ \\begin{array}{cccccc} i^{(m)} = m\\left[(1+i)^{1/m}-1\\right] &amp; &amp; d^{(m)} = m\\left[1- v^{1/m}\\right] \\\\ \\alpha(m) = \\frac{i}{i^{(m)}}\\frac{d}{d^{(m)}} &amp; &amp; \\beta(m) = \\frac{i-i^{(m)}}{i^{(m)}d^{(m)}} \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Next, from standard geometric sums employed in interest theory, we have \\[ \\begin{array}{cccccc} \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} v^{j/m} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{m}\\frac{1-v}{1-v^{1/m}} &amp; = \\frac{d}{d^{(m)}} \\\\ \\end{array} \\] and \\[ \\begin{array}{cccccc} \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} j~v^{j/m} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{v^{1/m}}{m} \\frac{1-v}{(1-v^{1/m})^2} - \\frac{v}{1-v^{1/m}} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{v^{1/m}}{(1-v^{1/m})} \\frac{d}{d^{(m)}} - \\frac{mv}{d^{(m)}} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{m}{i^{(m)}} \\frac{d}{d^{(m)}} - \\frac{mv}{d^{(m)}} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; mv \\left( \\frac{i}{i^{(m)}d^{(m)}} - \\frac{1}{d^{(m)}} \\right) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; mv ~\\beta(m) \\\\ \\end{array} \\] This yields \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} \\ddot{a}_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}}^{(m)} &amp;=_{UDD} \\frac{d}{d^{(m)}} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} v^{k} ~_k p_x - mv ~\\beta(m) \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ~_k p_x q_{x+k} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{d}{d^{(m)}} \\ddot{a}_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - v ~\\beta(m) A_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} ^ {1} \\\\ &amp;\\approx \\ddot{a}_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - \\frac{m-1}{2m} . \\\\ \\end{array} \\] 4.1.3 Contingent Cash Flows in Continuous Time By cash flows in continuous time, we are thinking of a situation where \\(m\\) becomes arbitrarily large. So, we could start with monthly (\\(m=12\\)), go to weekly (\\(m=52\\)), proceed to daily (\\(m=365\\)), and so forth. As we will see, there is little difference between a contract with daily payments versus instantaneous payments. However, the model with instantaneous payments (\\(m=\\infty\\)) is actually easier because we do not have to distinguish between payments at the beginning versus the end of the period. Models with instantaneous payments are easier to interpret and analyze in life insurance in contrast to life annuities. Because insurers typically pay benefits quickly upon the death of a policyholder, a model with payments at the moment of death is a better approximation than one that pays at the end of the year (\\(m=1\\)). Theoretically, one can think of a continuous life annuity as an approximation to a life annuity that pays 1/365 on a daily basis. However, given that life annuities are predominantly employed on a monthly (\\(m=12\\)) and quarterly (\\(m=4\\)) basis, we focus our attention on life insurance products in continuous time. It is possible to express present value random variables using a limit of equation (4.1) but it is much cleaner to simply utilize the moment of death random variable \\(T_x\\) with basic contract definitions, as follows: \\[ PV = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} v^{T_{\\bf x}} &amp; {\\text{whole life}} \\\\ v^{T_{\\bf x}}I(T_{\\bf x} \\le n) &amp; {n\\text{ year term}} \\\\ v^n I(T_{\\bf x} &gt;n) &amp; {n\\text{ year pure endowment}} \\\\ v^{T_{\\bf x}}I(T_{\\bf x} \\le n) +v^n I(T_{\\bf x} &gt;n) &amp; {n\\text{ year endowment}}.\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. \\] Expected present values can be readily determined using first principles. To illustrate, for a whole life insurance that pays at the moment of death, we have \\[ E(PV) = \\int_0^{\\infty} ~ v^t ~_t p_x \\mu_{x+t} dt = \\bar{A}_x . \\] For notation, we could use \\(~^{(\\infty)}\\) to signify payments with an infinite number of payment periods. However, it is traditional and part of International Actuarial Notation to use a bar (\\(\\bar{\\cdot}\\)) to denote payments at the moment of death. See Appendix Section 6.2 for more on actuarial notation. Similarly for an \\(n\\) year endowment, we have \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} E(PV) &amp;= \\int_0^n ~ v^t ~_t p_x \\mu_{x+t} dt + \\int_n^{\\infty} ~ v^n ~_t p_x \\mu_{x+t} dt \\\\ &amp;= \\int_0^n ~ v^t ~_t p_x \\mu_{x+t} dt + v^n ~_n p_x \\\\ &amp; = \\bar{A}_{{\\bf{x}}:\\enclose{actuarial}{n}} . \\end{array} \\] When a continuous time probability model is available, then these integrals can be computed directly (although they sometimes require numerical integration software). An alternative approach is to use the approximations based on \\(m^{th}\\)ly payments introduced in the prior section and let \\(m \\to \\infty\\). For example, for the whole life assuming UDD, we have \\[ \\bar{A}_x = \\lim_{m \\to \\infty} A_x^{(m)} = \\lim_{m \\to \\infty} \\frac{i}{i^{(m)}} A_x = \\frac{i}{\\delta} A_x , \\] where \\(\\delta = \\ln(1+i) = \\lim_{m \\to \\infty}i^{(m)}\\) is the force of interest, from interest theory. Section Structure Discussions Structure discussion. This section is general in the sense that it: integrates both life and annuity contracts under one umbrella readily allows variable interest rates and continuous time mortality without making assumptions such as UDD However. It does not relate insurance to annuity coverages. It only does second moments indirectly. It does not provide details for many contracts. At this stage, not sure how far to push this because I dont know how important the topic is relative to the other material Probably could use lots of exercises. Introduce classical actuarial PV symbols, variance calculations Calculation approaches Start with continuous time hazard survival models Describe approximations based on life table functions Differential equations? Continuous analog to the recursive formulas of insurances/annuities. (Develop this in the problem set). Use life annuities to motivate why it matters to account for more frequent premium and benefit payments Use life insurance to motivate why it a continuous payment model is a useful approximation (e.g., contractually obligated to settle payment immediately, subject to death confirmation) Review the present value random variable and moments. Draw timeline with more frequent payments. Introduce mthly insurances and annuities, as well as their relationship Introduce classical actuarial PV symbols, variance calculations Why is the frequency important? Demonstrate magnitude of difference in expected present values of payments (e.g., make a table of EPV vs various m) (without showing how calculations are done) Describe implementation using the continuous time Cox hazard model When life table is used, interim timing can be approximated via UDD, exponential. Possible extensions (or in appendices, problem sets): Does UDD work for all ages or covariates? Is there need to empirically investigate using our available data? Should we further explore other approximations using the model T_x = K_x +R_x, where R_x is the fractional term? Approximations of life annuities based on Woolhouse. Derivation is via Taylors expansion. (might also be an exercise) 4.2 Sampling Bias In Chapter 2 we saw that survival distributions, expressed as mortality rates, can vary not only by age and sex but also by other attributes such as smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and so forth. This naturally raises the question as whether these attributes are important in actuarial practice. To frame this question, this section reviews the statistical concept of sampling bias in the context of actuarial applications. 4.2.1 Population Subsets and Sampling Bias To illustrate differences among different samples, or subsets of a population, we consider three samples commonly used in actuarial practice: insured lives, individuals who have purchased life insurance, annuitant or pensioner lives, individuals who have either purchased an annuity or are a pensioner and so enjoy an annuity by participating in a retirement system, and a general population, where there is no requirement for insurance/annuity participation. To compare these three samples, we examine a specific case. Example 4.2.1. Korean Mortality by Insured Status. Here, we consider female mortality from South Korea for year 2007. The insured lives and annuitant rates were drawn from a database organized by the Society of Actuaries, https://mort.soa.org/. The general population data are drawn from the Human Mortality Database. Figure 4.3: Mortality by Insured Status. The left-hand panel summarizes mortality by one year rates \\(q_x\\) by age \\(x\\), the right-hand panel shows it by expectation of life \\(e_x\\). Both panels show three sampling frames: the solid black line is for insured lives, the dark-red dashed lines is for pension (annuitant) lives, and the dotted blue line represents the general population. Figure 4.3 compares these three samples using one year mortality rates \\(q_x\\) and expectation of life \\(e_x\\). Except for the highest ages where data are less reliable, the left-hand panel shows that pensioner (annuitant) mortality is the lowest among the three, followed by insured lives, and then the general population. The right-hand panel shows the same pattern, with pensioners enjoying the longest life expectancy and the general population showing the lowest. These patterns are commonly observed in actuarial practice. Individuals electing to purchase an annuity, or choosing an annuity option at retirement, generally consider themselves to be in good health. If they are in poor health, then they would not take on a contract that pays as long as they live. One might also elect to apply that same logic to the purchase of life insurance; that is, reason that only those who are in poor health purchase life insurance. However, insurers typically require individuals applying for life insurance to take a medical examination. So, by this selection mechanism, mortality for insured lives is also better than the general population. In the language of statistics, a sampling error occurs when the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is drawn, is not an adequate approximation of the population of interest. A sample must be a representative subset of a population, or universe, of interest. An example of a representative subset is a sample drawn at random. With substantial sample errors, the summary measure of the sample, the statistic, is not an adequate approximation of the corresponding summary measure of the population, the difference defined as a bias. If the sample is not representative, taking a larger sample does not eliminate bias, as the same mistake is repeated over again and again. So, using data from a sample that is not representative of a population of interest can result in sampling bias. For example, an analyst investigating an insurance product might use (typically convenient) population mortality instead of a more appropriate insured lives mortality; this mismatch results in sampling bias. As an another example, one might use insured lives mortality in lieu of pensioner mortality when valuing a retirement option for an insurance product. It is also common to use experience from one country to approximate outcomes in another. To illustrate, the following example compares experience among Poland, Japan, and the United States. Example 4.2.2. Mortality by Country (Japan, Poland, and the United States). This example focuses on population mortality and so recent 2019 experience is available from the Human Mortality Database. In addition to classification by country, we also look at experience by sex and age as these distinctions are well known. Figure 4.4 compares one year mortality rates among the three countries; the left-hand panel is for female experience and the right-hand is for males. Both panels demonstrate that Japan has the lowest mortality rates. The relationship between the United States and Poland is more complicated. For females, experience is roughly the same for ages above 50 although Poland has lower mortality rates for younger females. Younger polish men also have lower mortality rates than men in the US but the reverse is true for those older (than approximately 45). Figure 4.4: 2019 Mortality Rates by Country. Both panels show three countries that represent different sampling frames: the solid black line is for Japan, the dark-red dashed line is for Poland, and the dark-blue dotted line represents the United States. The left-hand panel summarizes female mortality, the right-hand panel represents males. Although we did not explicitly mention the sample sizes in Examples 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, they are large, and so do not confuse the issue of sampling bias with the uncertainty that arises from small data sets. The relationships observed among annuitants, insured lives, and general population as well as among countries demonstrated in these examples are commonly observed. To substantiate this claim, mortality rates from around the world are readily available at https://mort.soa.org/ and Human Mortality Database. Readers are encouraged to visit these primary sources and follow up with their own analyses. 4.2.2 Sampling Bias in Actuarial Practice In the prior subsection, we defined the concept of sampling bias and established that it could be a real concern in commonly encountered applications. However, you might have noticed that the vertical axes in the one year mortality rate graphs in Examples 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 are on a logarithmic scale. So the discrepancies among sampling bases seem real but how important are they in actuarial applications? To get insights into this question, we can use the different mortality distributions and, with the tools we learned in Chapter 3, express them in terms of expected present values. Example 4.2.1. Mortality by Insured Status - Continued. We use the female South Korean mortality experience introduced in Example 4.2.1 and, for illustration purposes, assume \\(i=4\\)%. For many new products or regions in the world with less detailed mortality data, it is common to use population mortality data in lieu of more appropriate insured lives or annuitant data. So, using population data, we first compute expected present values for a whole life insurance (\\(A_x^{pop}\\)) and for a life annuity due (\\(\\ddot{a}_x^{pop}\\)). Next, with the insured lives data, we compute the expected present values for a whole life insurance (\\(A_x^{ins}\\)). Lastly, with the annuitant lives data, we compute the expected present values for a life annuity due (\\(\\ddot{a}_x^{ann}\\)). Figure 4.5 summarizes the discrepancies by reporting the ratios. The left-hand panel shows the ratio \\(A_x^{ins}/A_x^{pop}\\). Except for the very high ages, we see that the ratio is considerably less than one. This is consistent with our earlier observations that population mortality is higher than insured lives mortality. If we think of the expected present values as representing prices (as developed in the next section), then the ratio also provides a basis for the analyst to decide whether the difference is important. Many insurance markets are competitive and one calculation basis being 90% of the other represents an important financial difference. The right-hand panel is the ratio \\(\\ddot{a}_x^{ann}/\\ddot{a}_x^{pop}\\). Here, the value of annuity under annuitant lives mortality is higher than that under general population mortality. This is consistent with our earlier observations that population mortality is higher than annuitant lives mortality. As with the insurance ratio, for many marketplaces this difference is financially meaningful. Figure 4.5: Dependence of Expected Present Values on Insured Status. The left-hand panel provides a ratio of \\(A_x\\) computed using insured lives mortality to that computed using general population mortality. The right-hand panel provides a ratio of \\(\\ddot{a}_x\\) computed using annuitant lives mortality to that computed using general population mortality. An annuity product pays benefits while an individual is alive whereas an insurance product pays benefits upon the death of an insured. So, to a certain extent, these two products offset one another. In financial terms, you can think about an annuity (based on an individuals survival) as a hedge for insurance (based on an individuals mortality). In the following Chapter 5 on premiums, we will take advantage of relationships of the form: \\[ A_x + d \\ddot{a}_x = 1. \\tag{4.3} \\] This is an exact relationship between the expected present values. However, this relationship holds under the assumption that the insurance and annuity expected present values use the same mortality. To dispel the notion that this holds more generally, Figure 4.6 shows the sum \\(A_x^{ins} + d \\ddot{a}_x^{ann}\\), computed using the mortality and interest assumptions in Example 4.2.1. Figure 4.6: The Sum \\(A_x^{ins} + d \\ddot{a}_x^{ann}\\). This sum is plotted versus age \\(x\\) and is clearly not identical to one, as suggested by equation (4.3). Exercise Quantify the use of annuity mortality applied to life insurance, and vice-versa, as examples. \\(\\require{enclose}\\) We motivated this section by questioning whether attributes such as smoking status and systolic blood pressure are important in actuarial practice. In the exercises, readers have the opportunity to determine expected present values of life contingent benefits that vary by these attributes. In this section, we learned we can attribute these discrepancies to differences among population subsets. In the next section, we frame the question of importance in terms of economic interpretations of the expected present values. Exercises Quantify expected present values of life contingent benefits that vary by smoking status and systolic blood pressure. 4.3 Using Economics to Motivate Insurance Features 4.3.1 Actuarially Fair Prices and Risk Classification You may have noticed in Chapter 3 that we paid special attention to the expected present values associated with random life contingent benefits and even gave them special symbols such as \\(A_x\\) and \\(\\ddot{a}_x\\). This is because insurance prices are based on these expectation of losses, a concept known as an actuarially fair price. In a simple model, an actuarially fair price is the result of an assumption of zero profits. Specifically, imagine a homogeneous population where all potential insureds have the same distribution of losses. If an insurer charges the expected loss to each insured, then the average profit over many such contracts would be zero by the law of large numbers. If there is only one insurer, then the company has a monopoly and so would charge more than this. It would charge the maximum that consumers are willing to pay (known as first degree price discrimination). If another company wishes to enter the marketplace, then it would charge something less than that maximum. With this price, it would take business away from the original insurer but still make a long-run profit if the price exceeds the expectation. However, competition in the marketplace will lead the original company to undercut, and so on. In the end, all profits will be competed away and  because of price competition  the companies will offer products at their expected value. One can also interpret fairness from a social justice perspective. One can imagine a group of individuals forming a risk class pooling their losses. Through the pooling mechanism, each person is no longer responsible for their individual loss but rather for their share of the pools combined loss. From a moral perspective, the responsibility for the loss can now be thought of as not due to the behavior of the faulty individual but rather attributed to the collective; in this sense, pooling socializes responsibility and creates a sense of shared responsibility among a group of people. This, combined with a certain understanding of equality and justice, creates a type of insurance solidarity. It is not the same type of solidarity that one thinks of in political movements, which embody a conscious identification with the group, emotional bonds, shared values and beliefs, and so forth. It is solidarity that emphasizes mutual responsibility, reciprocity, and a particular shared understanding of fairness. From this understanding of fairness comes the observation that if members of the pool have the same risk distribution when entering the pool, then they should have the same responsibility for the pool losses. As with economic reasoning, the law of large numbers implies that this share is the expectation of losses. Actuarially fair pricing is a foundation of insurance pricing. Combining a probabilistic viewpoint of an expected value and an interpretation of fairness, oftentimes the expectation of a present value of a random loss is known as an actuarial present value. Another foundation of insurance pricing is risk classification, defined to be the grouping of insureds into homogeneous classes. As mentioned above, by homogeneous we mean that each insured within a group has the same distribution of potential losses. Even within a homogeneous class of insureds, there clearly will be stark differences after observing their mortality. But, before experience is observed, everyone has the same chance (or distribution of outcomes) in a homogeneous class. Combining these ideas, one can see how insurance prices in competitive marketplaces are based on an actuarial present value for each risk class. Thus, development of distinct risk classes is a critical to fair insurance pricing. 4.3.2 Selection and Adverse Selection To develop distinct risk classes, insurers can use their underwriting processes to select subsets of a population. For example, as described in Example 4.2.1, when an individual applies for life insurance, it is common for insurers to require a medical examination. Insurers only issue their so-called standard policies to individuals who have passed the medical exam. By this mechanism, they are effectively selecting a subset of the population that is healthier than the general population. (Insurers also issue substandard policies, at a higher cost, to those with complicated health histories, like diabetes or heart disease, as well as drug, alcohol, or tobacco abuse.) However, it is known that these selection effects do not continue indefinitely. For example, Table 4.1 shows an excerpt from individual insurance mortality tables for females from Canada. To help read this table, consider a woman who became insured at age \\(x=50\\) who initially has a mortality rate of 0.00047; one year later (at age 51) she has a mortality rate of 0.00072. This second rate is higher than 0.00053, the mortality rate for a woman who became insured at age \\(x=51\\). This suggests that the selection effect is becoming less important. Further, from the table we see that selection effects last for 15 years; thereafter, rates are blended into an ultimate column. So for example, consider two females currently age 66 where one purchased insurance 16 years ago at age 50 and the other purchased insurance 15 years ago at age 51. Both have the same ultimate rate, \\(q_{66} = 0.01209\\). Table 4.1: Select and Ultimate Female Canadian Mortality Rates Age Select=0 Select=1 Select=2 Select=3 Select=4 Select=10 Select=14 Ultimate Mortality Ultimate Age 50 0.00047 0.00072 0.00095 0.00120 0.00150 0.00455 0.00948 0.01096 65 51 0.00053 0.00080 0.00106 0.00135 0.00169 0.00525 0.01056 0.01209 66 52 0.00059 0.00090 0.00119 0.00152 0.00190 0.00615 0.01163 0.01321 67 53 0.00066 0.00101 0.00134 0.00171 0.00214 0.00704 0.01271 0.01433 68 54 0.00074 0.00114 0.00151 0.00193 0.00240 0.00794 0.01379 0.01546 69 Individual Life Experience Subcommittee, Construction of CIA9704 Mortality Tables for Canadian Individual Insurance based on data from 1997 to 2004, Canadian Institute of Actuaries (2010). Accessed: October, 2021 from http://www.cia-ica.ca/docs/default-source/2010/210028e.pdf Data retrieved from https://mort.soa.org/ (Table 1458) Why do insurers bother with the cost and other administrative expenses of requiring a medical exam? They do so because they are concerned with a problem known as adverse selection, defined as a situation when consumers know more about their own risk characteristics than insurers. Specifically, without a medical exam, applicants have more knowledge of their medical history and general health status than the insurer. The problem arises because, without a medical exam requirement, it is more likely that people in poor health would apply for life insurance. People in poor health tend to have higher mortality rates that, as we have seen, results in higher actuarial present values for life insurance products. Abstracting from this a bit, you can think of the insurance pool as being comprised of two groups, those in good health and those in poor health. Providing a single insurance price for both groups violates the fundamental principle of risk classification. As we did in Section 4.3.1, it is easy to construct scenarios based on two insurers, one recognizing health differences and the other not doing so. In the long-run, the latter company becomes priced out of the marketplace. Insurers argue that by knowing about risk factors such as health status, the entire marketplace is better. Indeed, the entire purpose of risk classification is to mitigate the problem of adverse selection. In this section, we have seen the selection consequences of introducing, or not, a medical exam. As demonstrated in Table 4.1, when a medical exam is introduced, we are essentially fine-tuning our definition of homogeneous classes by including not only factors such as sex and age but also time since a medical exam was taken. By not requiring a medical exam, we introduce heterogeneity into our risk groups and so lose the advantages associated with risk classification. In the following subsection, we introduce other problem situations that result in heterogeneous risk groups. 4.3.3 Asymmetric Information Adverse selection occurs when the additional information that the insured has is important and not revealed to the insurers, such as a poor health history. Adverse selection is a type of unequal access to information, known as information asymmetry. Another type of information asymmetry is moral hazard. In moral hazard, the insurance contract itself changes the distribution of risks. To illustrate, by purchasing insurance, insureds have the incentive to take on more risks (thus increasing the probability of a risky event). For example, after purchasing life insurance, the insured may become decide to take up sky-diving, high-speed race car driving, or a life of crime. If the insurer knows about the risky activity in advance, then appropriate adjustments to the price may be made (or the contract simply not issued). The problem arises if the risky activity is taken on after the contract is issued; prices are based on one set of circumstances, losses based on another. Typically this mismatch results in a loss for the insurer. To mitigate this type of problem, insurers may introduce coverage restrictions. For example, life insurance contracts often do not pay benefits for deaths incurred while committing a crime or participating in an illegal activity. This bit on genetic testing may go into an Appendix or sidebar. Consumers often purchase life insurance to provide benefits for their loved ones in the event of their untimely demise and thus provide a bit of peace of mind. Moreover, there are other, more subtle, ways that the introduction of an insurance contract can change the behavior of consumers, not all in positive ways. One example is genetic testing. Genetic testing involves a type of medical test that examines chromosomes, genes, or proteins. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a persons chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder. There are many different purposes for testing, including medical (such as diagnosing a genetic disease or predicting disease risk) and non-medical (such as confirming parentage or forensic investigation). Insurers worry about genetic testing information because of information asymmetry concerns. Like the purchase of life insurance, the decision to undergo genetic testing is voluntary. When a potential policyholder has information about his or her health that is not shared with the insurance company, this could lead to anti-selection where poorer risks purchase more insurance and better risks purchase little or no insurance. From an insurers viewpoint, one solution would be to allow insurers to require genetic testing, just as they are allowed to evaluate other aspects (e.g., weight, hypertension, and so forth) of a persons health. One way that genetic testing differs from, e.g., blood pressure, is through the impact that it has on a persons willingness to undergo the testing for fear of being denied life insurance. As summarized by Prince (2019), Empirical evidence shows that fear of genetic discrimination has led individuals across the globe to refuse to participate in genetic research projects or to fail to undergo recommended clinical testing. In this way, genetic testing also represents a type of moral hazard in the sense that the presence of an insurance contract can change a persons behavior. Another implication of moral hazard is that people tend to increase their risk unless given incentives not to. Conversely, people may also reduce their risks when given incentives to do so. Indeed, much of modern risk management is predicated on introducing risk mitigation tools to reduce the impact of insured events. A classic example is the nonsmoker discounts in life insurance. Another type of information asymmetry can occur when an insurer has less information than other competing insurance companies about the risk levels of its customers (cf. Cather 2018). This can result in cream skimming, because the innovative insurer targets the best risks who, like cream in a container of fresh milk, rise, to the top of a pool of policyholders. To illustrate, consider the Section 4.3.2 that we discussed where one insurer has knowledge of an insureds health status and another does not. The insurer with this knowledge would target risks in good health because these are the ones, other things being equal, would enjoy a lower present value of benefits paid resulting in greater profits for the insurer. Later, we may wish to gently insert a bit about discrimination/algorithmic bias. 4.4 Contingent Payment Applications Our work so far has focused on modeling financial implications of survival as the time to event. This is easy to justify; the life insurance industry represents a major piece of the world economy. For example, in 2019, this industry accounted for 2512 trillons of U.S. dollars in developed (OECD) countries, representing more than 3.9 percent of the global economy (OECD (2020)). Nonetheless, life contingent techniques apply more broadly than only human mortality and so in this section we emphasize by referring to them as contingent techniques (omitting the life part). As our first example, Section 4.5 describes a relatively small but quickly growing marketplace on pet insurance. As a second example, Section 4.6 introduces disability income insurance. In this latter example, we present applications where the time to event is not the time to death but rather the time to recovery from disability. These examples illustrate that contingent payment techniques can be used to understand financial implications of a time to event and that event need not be human mortality. Another example that we will see later in the book is the time to death of the first of two people. Section Structure Discussions Here are a few more examples that could be included in problems or just mentioned in passing. Consider workers compensation where a benefit is paid when a worker gets into an accident (at work) and receives benefit payments for many years. The event time is the sooner of recovery or retirement. General insurance actuaries often dont worry about time value of money but they should. Time to divorce is a good example used in labor economics extensively. Might use the 2014 paper (https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13524-013-0278-1.pdf) that has a fitted Cox regression model. (Pension valuation would be an actuarial application.) Other labor economic examples include time in and out of employment, time until first child, and many others. Real Estate Valuation. This is an old, old topic.

(2021) 4.5 Pet Insurance 4.5.1 Introduction to Pet Health Insurance The COVID pandemic that began in 2019 changed life in many ways. Several studies have reported that as many businesses shifted their employees to remote work-from-home schedules, the demand for acquiring or fostering a new pet grew, Hoffman, Thibault, and Hong (2021). Of course, there are costs associated with these new members of a household, some of which can be reasonably predicted and budgeted for (such as food and toys), others which are unexpected (e.g., kennel boarding of a pet when an emergency trip is to be taken by the owner), and still others that could not be remotely foreseen (e.g., the costs of repairing damages your dog did to buildings, living quarters, or other property). Naturally, insurance is one mechanism for paying for costs not anticipated. Pet insurance is a relatively small portion of the insurance marketplace but, even prior to the onslaught of the COVID pandemic, had been growing rapidly, Malloy (2018). Types of Pet Insurance. As with humans, there are many types of risks associated with pets. If one has a large or aggressive dog, then it may be necessary to purchase third party liability that covers damages your pet may do to other parties (similar to third party auto insurance). Several European countries (e.g., Sweden, Spain, parts of Germany) have requirements that dog owners maintain coverage for liability to third parties for the action of pets. In the U.S., pet owner liability to third parties from injuries caused by common household pets is generally covered by the owners homeowners or renters insurance policy, as long as the animal is not an excluded breed and does not have a history of aggression, NAIC (2019). It is also possible to purchase life (and theft) insurance on pets. These coverages are designed to insure the lives of highly valuable animals, such as show dogs and cats. These policies reimburse owners for stolen animals and pay a death benefit if an animal dies during transport or other covered events. In terms of market share, the main type of pet insurance provides accident and illness coverage for family-owned pets, primarily dogs and cats. While some pet insurance plans also provide reimbursement for wellness procedures like vaccinations, heartworm testing and spaying or neutering, pet health insurance is primarily used to cover costs for accidents and unexpected illness. Typical coverages today can include exotic treatments such as acupuncture, chemotherapy, hydrotherapy, hyperbaric chamber treatments, oxygen treatments. In general, these coverages provide for anything that veterinarians prescribe to be medically necessary. Unlike life, theft, and pet liability coverage, pet health insurance is a stand-alone policy whose only purpose is to cover veterinary expenses. Policies have no face-value death benefit as with life insurance, although they can cover end of life expenses such as euthanasia. Factors. What are the important risk factors in determining costs associated with pet insurance? In general, analysts look to an animals age, sex, breed, location, and other components. For example, as described in Wilson (2020), it is known that : Mixed-breed dogs are generally less expensive to insure than purebred dogs. Younger dogs are less expensive to insure than older dogs. Smaller dogs are generally less expensive to insure than larger dogs. Interestingly, female cats are less expensive to insure than male cats, but the opposite is true for dogs. 4.5.2 Canine Mortality Like humans, dogs become increasingly frail as they age and, not surprisingly, incur additional costs to maintain a healthy lifestyle. So, consistent with the survival models developed in Chapter 2, we emphasize mortality patterns of pets, focusing on dogs / canines. Due to the developing and yet still competitive marketplace, it is not surprising that detailed data on costs of pet insurance are not widely available. Fortunately, this is not true of pet survival data, in part because many researchers interested in veterinary topics are publicly funded and have incentives to share their data. In this section, we draw on Pegram et al. (2021a), a study of the factors that influence determinants of the choice to euthanize a pet dog. In particular, their data are publicly available at Pegram et al. (2021b). In this dataset, there are 29865 observations used to study euthanasia. Our interest is in survival patterns by age and so we remove records where either the date of birth or death is missing or incorrect (we also removed 17 records with missing sex information); this results in 5933 records for analysis. Of these observations, 47.9% are female and 57.4% are neutered. Table 4.2 reports variation among the major types of breeds and causes of death. Table 4.2: Breed and Cause of Death Breed CauseDeath Crossbreed :1259 Disorder not diagnsosed:1126 Staffordshire Bull Terrier: 507 Collapsed : 523 Labrador Retriever : 481 Neoplasia : 522 Jack Russell Terrier : 352 Mass : 375 German Shepherd Dog : 234 Brain disorder : 350 Yorkshire Terrier : 192 Behaviour disorder : 341 (Other) :2908 (Other) :2696 For these data, the median age at death is 12.2 and the maximum is 21. Survival distributions by sex and being neutered appeared in Figure 4.7. The left-hand panel shows little difference by sex. The right-hand panel shows that dogs that have been neutered enjoy lower mortality. Figure 4.7: Survival Distributions by Sex and Being Neutered Figure 4.8 shows survival distributions by breed where we plot distributions for the six most common breed types from Table 4.2, the remaining breeds are grouped into an Other category. The differences among survival distributions for different breeds is not surprising. Breeds may be a proxy for the size and weight of a dog; a larger dog like a Labrador has more risk than a smaller dog like a Jack Russell terrier, for example. The debate about whether mixed-breed dogs are generally healthier than purebred dogs is still ongoing among veterinary professionals. On the one hand, mixed breed dogs may be carriers of genetic mutations that lead to health issues; on the other hand, they are less likely than purebreds to develop the disorders themselves. As noted in NAIC (2019), it is common for insurance carriers to group the breeds into 10 to 12 rating categories, with each category assigned a rating factor. Figure 4.8: Survival Distributions by Breed Table 4.3 summarizes the result of a (Cox proportional hazards) regression model fit using sex, being neutered, and breed as covariates. As suggested by Figure 4.7, the results suggest that sex is not an important variable given the other variables in the model. Further, there may be further opportunities to reduce the number of levels of the Breed variable as the Staffordshire Bull Terrier and Labrador Retriever distributions are not significantly different from the composite Other category.

These calculations are only for demonstration purposes; naturally, analysts that have access to detailed insurance costs will be able to sharpen our estimates. To begin, consider a male dog that is neutered belonging to the Crossbreed breed. Then, it is straightforward to determine one-year mortality rates, as summarized in Figure 4.9. R Code to Convert Cox Regression Model Output to One-Year Mortality Rates Cox_ph_1 &lt;- coxph(Surv(AgeAtDeath) ~ Sex+Neutered+Breed2, data=DogMort) sfit &lt;- survfit(Cox_ph_1,newdata = data.frame(Sex=&quot;Male&quot;, Neutered=&quot;Neutered&quot;, Breed2 = &quot;Crossbreed&quot;)) #plot(sfit) sx &lt;- summary(sfit, times = 0:22)$surv sx[1] = 1 qx &lt;- 1 - sx[2:22]/sx[1:21] qx[21] =1 plot(0:20,qx, xlab = &quot;Age (x)&quot;, ylab = expression(q[x]), type = &quot;both&quot;) Figure 4.9: One Year Mortality Rates for a Neutered Male Crossbreed From this estimated mortality, it straightforward to estimate financial costs, as illustrated in the following. Example. Surgical Veterinary Care. Owning a pet can be expensive. According to the American Pet Products Associations 2021-2022 National Pet Owners Survey, the basic annual expenses for caring for a dog are 1480. This total cost consists of: Surgical vet (458), food (287), routine visit (242), kennel boarding (228), food treats (81), vitamins (81), toys 56), and groomer/grooming aids (47) (Source: III (2021)). What about unanticipated costs? We estimate the actuarial present value associated with just one component, the surgical veterinary expenses, over a lifetime for a male dog aged \\(x\\) that has been neutered. As our baseline initial cost, we use 458 USD per year. Now, we know that expenses increase as a dog ages and we assume an annual increase of 11%. This may seem high but we are assuming a 3% increase due to inflation and an 8% real growth rate. The real growth rate is based on the rating scale from a large carrier where the age rating factor starts at 1 for pets ages 2-11 months and increases to 4.5 for pets over 20 years old, see Wilson (2020). To compute the actuarial present value, we use the expression \\[ APV = ({\\text {Initial Ann Cost}}) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\omega - x - 1} v^k ~(1.11)^k ~_k p_x . \\] This is based on equation (3.3) with the \\(k\\)-year survival probability \\(~_kp_x\\) and cost \\(~_kC = ({\\text {Initial Ann Cost}})~(1.11)^k\\) \\(= 458 ~(1.11)^k\\). The discount factor is 3% for investments (so \\(v=1/1.03\\)) and the highest age is \\(\\omega = 22\\). The calculations are summarized in Table 4.4. Not surprisingly, we see that older dogs (e.g., \\(x=12\\)) have a lower lifetime expectancy and thus a lower actuarial present value. In the same way, the German Shepard Dog has a high mortality than the Crossbreed, and so has a lower actuarial present value.

In 1947, the first pet insurance policy was issued in the United Kingdom (UK). In Sweden and the UK, modern pet insurance policies are designed with the ability to cover pet medical costs and liability to third parties for the action of pets. In the U.S., the first pet policy was issued in 1982 that covered the dog that played Lassie on a popular U.S. television series, III (2021). Pet insurance is more common in European countries than in the United States, with half of all pets in Sweden covered by pet health insurance. In the U.S., only about 1% of dogs and cats kept as pets are covered by pet insurance. As noted in Section 4.5.1, in part this is due to regulatory requirements. It may also be due to the longer history that pet insurance has enjoyed in parts of Europe. Nonetheless, the pet insurance marketplace has been expanding rapidly in the U.S. with (premium) growth rates exceeding 10% for many years. According to a survey conducted by a large U.S. carrier, the fastest-growing form of distribution [of pet health insurance] is through an employee benefit package with about fifty percent of Fortune 500 companies offering pet insurance as an employee benefit, NAIC (2019). Regulations and Economics From a regulatory perspective, in the U.S. pet insurance falls under the property/casualty area of insurance because pets are, in effect, property. This places a bit of a burden on actuaries in that statutory reporting follows traditional property and casualty procedures whereas other aspects of pet insurance are more akin to (human) health practices; in the U.S., health insurance is regulated separately from property/casualty insurance. Adverse selection, introduced in Section 4.3.2, is an important aspect of health insurance. It is natural for those in poor health to seek health insurance because they can reasonably expect higher costs. This can be a problem for insurers if they are unaware of the poor health conditions (we called this information asymmetry in Section 4.3.3). In many jurisdictions such as the U.S., there are rules that prohibit insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing (typically poor health) conditions. In contrast, for pet insurance animals with pre-existing conditions are generally not eligible for coverage. This avoids, for example, a situation in which a pet owner could find out his or her dog has cancer or another condition requiring expensive treatment and then tries to buy insurance to cover it. Pet insurers also need to be aware of another type of information asymmetry, moral hazard, where the presence of the insurance cover alters survival probabilities (recall Section 4.3.3). Moral hazard is not necessarily bad. In fact, perhaps the primary reason that veterinarians promote pet health insurance is so that they may advise pet owners on appropriate medical treatments and not be hampered by cost concerns. For example, sometimes veterinarians feel they must offer euthanasia as an option because the animal may be suffering from a treatable condition but the client may be unable to afford the proposed treatment due to lack of pet insurance, a situation termed economic euthanasia. 4.6 Disability Income Insurance 4.6.1 Introduction to Disability Income Insurance Disability income insurance is a contract designed to provide a regular income, such as monthly, to an individual if he or she is prevented by sickness or injury from working. Policies are available on an individual basis, through membership in a group such as sponsored by an employer, and through public government sponsored insurance. The data that we consider are from the U.S. Social Security Disability Income program, Zayatz (2015). Because disability provides benefits to those unable to work, it is not designed to be a substitute for a retirement benefit and so is usually available for a fixed term or age, such as ceasing at age 65 as in our illustrative example. Like annuity benefits introduced in Section 3.3, the benefit is paid periodically until a random event time. However, for a life annuity, the payment stops when the policyholder dies (a sad event). In contrast, for a disability income policy, the payment stops when someone recovers from disability (a happy event). Contingent payment techniques can be employed for general event times that need not be tied to human mortality. Naturally, there are a few caveats to this important message. For example, both life annuities and disability income may be limited by a fixed term or age. Further, as we will see, disability income may cease upon the sooner of recovery or death, another type of event time. 4.6.2 Disability Recovery Rates To better appreciate how often policyholders recover from disability, Figure 4.10 shows male rates (\\(q_x^r\\)) from the U.S. Social Security Disability Income program (Zayatz (2015), Table 14A). The solid black line, denoted as Select=0 is for individuals who met program qualifications for disability benefits and then recovered from their disability within a year. As suggested in the figure, except for age less than about 22, this experience is very similar to individuals who had been in the program for two years, Select=2. The other four lines represent greater number of years of selection (4, 6, 8, and an ultimate column); visually, they seem similar to one another. This figure demonstrates the importance of the select effect and is consistent with medical selection in life insurance that we saw in Section 4.3.2. In both cases, recent admission to a program or policy can influence the event time experience. Figure 4.10: Disability Recovery Rates by Attained Age and Select Period. A plot of recovery rates \\(q_x^r\\) by attained age \\(x\\). Each line represents a different select period. The lines for select 0 and 2 are similar, other lines are also similar, suggesting that selection effects have worn out beginning at select = 4. As we saw in Section 2.1.1, another way of looking at event times is by following cohorts of individuals. Figure 4.11 follows recovery rates for several cohorts. The figure shows that annual probabilities of recovery decline with advancing age. Further, from Zayatz (2015), the early year probability of recovery patterns are attributed to the scheduling of continuing disability reviews. For example, where medical improvement is expected, the review is scheduled for 6 to 24 months following the most recent disability decision. Where medical improvement is not expected, the review is scheduled between 5 and 7 years later. These patterns are most evident in the cohort depicted by the bold solid black line that follows males who entered the disability program at age 16. This is the youngest cohort in the data set; it has the least amount of experience and so is the most uncertain. From Figure 4.11, we see a very large spike in recovery rates after five or six years in the program. This spike is also evident in cohorts that entered at ages 21 and 26 although on a smaller scale. The jump in recovery rates beginning at Cohort=31 and on is still evident but on a much lower scale. Figure 4.11: Disability Recovery Rates by Attained Age and Cohort. A plot of recovery rates \\(q_x^r\\) by attained age \\(x\\). Each line represents a different cohort. The cohort first receiving disability benefits at age 16 show a strong recovery rate about five years later. This effect is also evident, although not as pronounced, in cohorts 21 and 26. Recovery rates seem to dampen as age (both cohort and attained) increases. 4.6.3 Actuarial Present Values of Disability Income To get a sense of the benefit to an individual, and the cost to the program, we can compute actuarial present values. Calculation of the actuarial present value is that same as the term life annuity introduced in Section 3.3.2 in that we assume the benefit terminates at age 65. Further, instead of probability of death we now use probability of recovery from disability (and hence exiting the program). Using an assumed \\(i=\\) 4 percent interest rate, Figure 4.12 summaries annuity calculations by attained age for several different cohorts. These annuity values assume a payment of 1 at the beginning of the year if one is in the program; for perspective, as reported in Zayatz (2015), in 2013 (the year of the study) disability income worker beneficiaries received approximately 14,000 USD per year. Although there are some differences at younger cohorts and attained ages, Figure 4.12 shows remarkable agreement among cohorts beginning about age 30. In the figure, the thick dashed blue line marks annuity values for the Cohort=31; all annuity values are similar to this line. We can interpret this to mean that the actuarial present value depends on the attained age for 30 and above, not the cohort representing when an individual first entered the program. Figure 4.12: Annuities by Attained Age and Cohort. A plot of annuities \\(ä_x^r\\) by attained age \\(x\\). Each line represents a different cohort. The first two cohorts plotted first receiving disability benefits at age 16 and 21 differ in the early annuity values. Beginning at attained age 30, all annuity values appear to be qualitatively similar. The thick dashed blue line marks annuity values for the cohort=31. Figure 4.13 supplements that actuarial present values by providing an analysis for female workers. The top two lines of the figure show that male and female actuarial present values are virtually indistinguishable when the event time is recovery. Based on our prior work, this figure only presents Cohort=31. The lower two lines in Figure 4.13 consider the event time to be the sooner of recover and death for males and females, respectively. That is, a worker may leave the program due to recover from disability as well as death. So, when computing actuarial present values, this broader measure of exiting the program is used. The lower two lines show that female annuities are above male annuities; this is consistent with our prior observations that females generally live longer then males. Figure 4.13: Annuities by Attained Age, Gender and Type of Departure. A plot of annuities \\(ä_x^r\\) by attained age \\(x\\). The top two lines are represent departing from the disability program via recovery from disability. The two lines are for male and female and are virtually indistinguishable. The bottom two lines represent departing from the disability program via recovery from disability or by death. Female annuities are above male annuities (in that females generally live longer then males). 4.6.4 More on Disability Income Insurance This brief introduction to disability income focused on demonstrating an important application where contingent payment methods need not use mortality as the time to an event. Because of its brevity, we have omitted many important attributes of disability income such as a waiting time for benefit eligibility, the role of monthly payments, differences among individual, group, and public programs, as well as features of different international marketplaces. For a deeper dive into this fascinating topic, see Haberman and Pitacco (2018). In particular, we have not yet addressed the cost of becoming disabled. What we have done is provide actuarial present values of the benefit of a disability insurance program. However, for a worker, we have not yet described the probability of being disabled. More generally, in a workers lifetime, someone start as an active worker, become disabled, and as we have seen, that the person may soon recover from the disability and then re-enter the work force. This pattern of switching statuses between between healthy and working and disabled and receiving benefits, and costs associated with each status, is the topic of Chapter 7 on multiple state modeling.

We can discuss whether this is appropriate for life contingencies, or further improve on the explanation/motivation.

Source: This is adapted from the Wikipedia page Actuarial Notation. Legend: 1 - the 2 means double the force of interest 2 - the bar implies continuous, or payments at the moment of death. No bar, or blank, signifies payment at the end of the year. For annuities, could use a double dot that signifies payments at the beginning of the year. 3 - the 1 denotes a temporary, or term, payment. Paid if \\(x\\) within \\(n\\) years 4 - contract issued to a life aged \\(x\\) and lasts for at most \\(n\\) years. 5 - the A signifies it is an insurance (assurance) contract. Could also be a lower case \\(a\\) that would signify an annuity contract. 6 - deferred m years Note: It is sometimes helpful to put a space before the pre-subscript like \\(\\frac{\\ell_{[x]+t}}{\\ell_{[x]}} = ~_{t}p_{[x]}\\). Else you get this awkward \\(\\frac{\\ell_{[x]+t}}{\\ell_{[x]}} = _{t}p_{[x]}\\). \\[ Y = \\begin{cases} 1 + v + v^2 + \\cdots + v^K = \\ddot{a}_{\\enclose{actuarial}{K+1}}, K=0,1,\\ldots,n-1 \\\\ 1 + v + v^2 + \\cdots + v^{n-1} = \\ddot{a}_{\\enclose{actuarial}{n}}, K \\ge n \\end{cases} \\] Note. For the html version of the text, we are using the STACK system; in particular, see their actuarial notation page. This does not appear to work for the pdf version, at least with R-Studio. The latex package actuarialangle provides a substitute. To make this happen, in our latex header .tex page, we have the following bit of code % Something for the Actuarial Angle package \\usepackage{actuarialangle} \\newcommand{\\enclose}[1]{\\actuarialangle} 6.3 General Conventions Random variables are denoted by upper-case italicized Roman letters, with \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\) denoting a claim size variable, \\(N\\) a claim count variable, and \\(S\\) an aggregate loss variable. Realizations of random variables are denoted by corresponding lower-case italicized Roman letters, with \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) for claim sizes, \\(n\\) for a claim count, and \\(s\\) for an aggregate loss. Probability events are denoted by upper-case Roman letters, such as \\(\\Pr(\\mathrm{A})\\) for the probability that an outcome in the event A occurs. Cumulative probability functions are denoted by \\(F(z)\\) and probability density functions by the associated lower-case Roman letter: \\(f(z)\\). For distributions, parameters are denoted by lower-case Greek letters. A caret or hat indicates a sample estimate of the corresponding population parameter. For example, \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is an estimate of \\(\\beta\\) . The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers, say, \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\), is usually denoted by \\(\\bar{x}\\); the use of \\(x\\), of course, is optional. Use upper-case boldface Roman letters to denote a matrix other than a vector. Use lower-case boldface Roman letters to denote a (column) vector. Use a superscript prime \\(\\prime\\) for transpose. For example, \\(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}\\) is a quadratic form. Acronyms are to be used sparingly, given the international focus of our audience. Introduce acronyms commonly used in statistical nomenclature but limit the number of acronyms introduced. For example, pdf for probability density function is useful but GS for Gini statistic is not. 6.4 Abbreviations Here is a list of abbreviations that we adopt. We italicize these acronyms. For example, we can discuss the goodness of fit in terms of the AIC criterion. \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\hline \\textbf{Symbol} &amp; \\textbf{Description} \\\\ \\hline AIC &amp; \\text{Akaike information criterion} \\\\ BIC &amp; \\text{(Schwarz) Bayesian information criterion} \\\\ cdf &amp; \\text{cumulative distribution function} \\\\ df &amp; \\text{degrees of freedom} \\\\ iid &amp; \\text{independent and identically distributed} \\\\ GLM &amp; \\text{generalized linear model} \\\\ mle &amp; \\text{maximum likelihood estimate/estimator}\\\\ ols &amp; \\text{ordinary least squares} \\\\ pdf &amp; \\text{probability density function} \\\\ pmf &amp; \\text{probability mass function} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] 6.5 Common Statistical Symbols and Operators Here is a list of commonly used statistical symbols and operators, including the latex code that we use to generate them (in the parens). \\[ \\begin{array}{cl} \\hline \\textbf{Symbol} &amp; \\textbf{Description} \\\\ \\hline I(\\cdot) &amp; \\text{binary indicator function (}I\\text{).

This reference has a terrific feature that many latex symbols are defined in the article. Further, there is a long history of discussion and debate surrounding actuarial notation; see (Boehm et al. 1975) for one contribution.
