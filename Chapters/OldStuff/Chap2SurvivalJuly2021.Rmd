# Modeling Lifetimes

The analysis of life contingent exposures such as insurer's liability when selling a life insurance contract or a pension fund's obligations when offering a new pension scheme starts with modeling individual *lifetime* and *death*.  These models, in turn, have to be calibrated in the context of relevant (mortality) data.  

Therefore, in this chapter, we first present different types of data that describe the lifetimes and mortality of a certain population.  We deliberately introduce the data in Section \@ref(S:MortData) without assuming prior knowledge of life contingent modeling, and aim to develop an intuitive understanding of some of the associated challenges.  

We then introduce the conventional framework for modeling lifetimes, particularly by introducing the concept of a future lifetime variable $T_{\bf x}$ and its properties, and we then explore various approaches of specifying and estimating its distribution. Here, we discuss the traditional actuarial models for lifetimes such as analytical mortality laws and life tables, but we also introduce conditional predictive models that characterize the lifetime distribution based on a set of covariates or *features*.

## Mortality data: Life Expectancies, Deaths, Counts, \& Lifetimes {#S:MortData}

### Life Expectancies {#S:DataLifeExp} 

Perhaps the most relevant question to any individual when it comes to their future lifetime is: how long am I expected to live? As we will discuss, there are many angles to this question. However, as a first and proximate answer, we may rely on public statistics. Government agencies around the world publish vital statistics such as the *life expectancies* for their population, which are typically separated by age and gender -- and potentially other attributes such as race. 

The file `CDCLifeExp.csv` is provided with the supplemental information of this text and includes an excerpt of the U.S. [national vital statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_07-508.pdf) that provides "Expectation of life, by age, race, [...] and sex: United States, 2017" in Table \@ref(tab:MortChapCDC).

```{r MortChapCDC}
library(knitr)
us_les <- read.csv("Data/CDCLifeExp.csv")
kable(us_les, caption="Life Expectancies From 2017 U.S. National Vital Statistics")
```

This excerpt provides the life expectancy for ages 0 (newborn), 20, 40, 60, and 80 observed within a population, for males and females with separate figures for the hispanic subpopulation. There are a few immediate observations. 

First, females generally seem to have a longer life expectancy than males, whereas the aggregate "Total" life expectancy is in between the two figures.  This is intuitive as the aggregate population is (largely) made up of male and female individuals, so that the "Total" life expectancy is a weighted average of the gender-specific life expectancies, relative to the composition of the population. 

Second, life expectancy is decreasing in age, which again is intuitive: older individuals will have shorter life expectancies, ceteris paribus.  It may be somewhat less obvious that the differences in life expectancies are less than the differences in age; subtracting the lines in Table \@ref(tab:MortChapCDC) gives incremental life expectancies for 20-year age gaps.

```{r}
kable(us_les[1:4,2:7]-us_les[2:5,2:7])
```
Hence, while a 40-year-old male is twenty years older than a 20-year-old male, the 20-year-old's life expectancy is 18.3 years higher.  The difference of 1.7 years is due to the possibility of the 20-year-old not surviving up to age 40. Consider the following: 40-year-old males lived 20 years since age 20 plus they are expected to live another 38.7 years, for a total of 58.7 years; in contrast, 20-year-old males have a life expectancy of 57 years, which is 1.7 years less. In other words, 40-year-old males have a higher expected age at death than 20-year-old males, because view view them *conditionally* on already having lived until age 40. As the table reveals, this effect is more pronounced when comparing a 40-year-old with a 60-year-old or a 60-year-old with an 80-year-old.

Third, the life expectancies for the hispanic subpopulation exceed the figures of the total population, which suggests that other subpopulations must exhibit a lower life expectancy. There are many questions of potential reasons for this difference, although these fall more in the demographic or even sociological realm. For insstance, there are many interesting studies related to the dependence of life expectancies on socio-economic factors, including some concerning recent trends related to so-called "[deaths of despair](https://www.vox.com/2020/4/15/21214734/deaths-of-despair-coronavirus-covid-19-angus-deaton-anne-case-americans-deaths)" in the U.S.

From an actuarial perspective, a relevant question may be how we could model the mortality data.  In other words, is there a simple parametric model that may describe the progression of life expectancy across ages, at least in the context of one particular population?  We will return to this question in the context of our mortality models, particularly in Section \@ref(S:AnalMortLaws).

As an early caveat to the question raised at the beginning of this section, it is not necessarily accurate to take these figures as estimates of a given individual's future lifetime or even its expectation.  This is the case since the *life expectancy* is usually generated based on recent mortality *experience* rather than  *forecasts*. As we will discuss in Section \@ref(S:LifeTab), this is the difference between the so-called *period* and *cohort* life expectancies.

### Population Mortality Counts {#S:HMDData}

We now bring into consideration *mortality experience* for populations that had been observed over time, which is available at the [Human Mortality Database (HMD)](https://www.mortality.org) for a wide range of countries.  The available data include *Exposures* by age, sex, and calender year period, i.e. how many people people of a given age and sex lived in the country's population during a given period of time, and corresponding *Deaths*, i.e. how many of these individuals had died.

In the supplemental information to this text, we provide exposures and deaths for the U.S. population, downloaded from the HMD as `HMD_Expo.csv` and `HMD_Deaths.csv`. We use the data over five year intervals starting at 1935 until 2015. Let us take a look at the exposures:
```{r}
us_exp <- read.csv("Data/HMD_Expo.csv")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
us_exp$Year_start <- as.character(us_exp$Year_start)
us_exp$Year_end <- as.character(us_exp$Year_end)
```
```{r}
kable(head(us_exp), align = "cccrrr", digits = 2, format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
us_exp$Year_start <- as.numeric(us_exp$Year_start)
us_exp$Year_end <- as.numeric(us_exp$Year_end)
```
and deaths:
```{r}
us_deaths <- read.csv("Data/HMD_Deaths.csv")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
us_deaths$Year_start <- as.character(us_deaths$Year_start)
us_deaths$Year_end <- as.character(us_deaths$Year_end)
```
```{r}
kable(head(us_deaths), align = "cccrrr", digits = 2, format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
us_deaths$Year_start <- as.numeric(us_deaths$Year_start)
us_deaths$Year_end <- as.numeric(us_deaths$Year_end)
```

To illustrate, let us plot the exposures and deaths for a 70-year-old U.S. females over time, which is given in Figure \@ref(fig:70ChapHMDUSFigsa):

`r HideRCode('70ChapHMDUSFigs',"R Code For Figure")`

```{r 70ChapHMDUSFigs, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, comment=NA, eval=FALSE}  
options(digits = 9)
options(scipen = 9)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,2], us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,4]/1000, type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "green", main="Exposures", xlab = "year", ylab = "count", ylim = c(0,max(us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,4])/1000))
plot(us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,2], us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,4]/1000, type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "red", main="Deaths", xlab = "year", ylab = "count", ylim = c(0,max(us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,4])/1000))
```

</div>

(ref:70ChapHMDUSFigs) **Exposures and Deaths (in thousands) for Females age 70 from the HMD U.S.** 

```{r 70ChapHMDUSFigsa, ref.label = '70ChapHMDUSFigs', fig.cap = '(ref:70ChapHMDUSFigs)', fig.width=8, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE}
```

The stark increase in exposures is due to two effects; on one hand, the U.S. population had been growing substantially since 1935, and on the other hand, individuals had been showing an enhanced life expectancy over time.  As a consequence, the number of 70-year-old U.S. females had increased from less than two million to more than six million.  In contrast, the number of deaths had been more steady. While with an increasing number of exposures the number of deaths have increased, the chance of dying for a 70-year-old had been decreasing. The latter becomes more evident by plotting the ratio of deaths and exposures as in Figure \@ref(fig:70DRChapHMDUSFigsa)

`r HideRCode('70DRChapHMDUSFigs',"R Code For Figure")`

```{r 70DRChapHMDUSFigs, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, comment=NA, eval=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
minlim <- min(us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,4]/us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,4])
maxlim <- max(us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,4]/us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,4])
plot(us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,2],us_deaths[us_deaths$Age == 70,4]/us_exp[us_exp$Age == 70,4],type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "blue", main="Deaths/Exposures", xlab = "year", ylab = "rate",ylim = c(minlim,maxlim))
rm(minlim, maxlim)
```

</div>

(ref:70DRChapHMDUSFigs) **Death rates for Females age 70 from the HMD U.S** 

```{r 70DRChapHMDUSFigsa, ref.label = '70DRChapHMDUSFigs', fig.cap = '(ref:70DRChapHMDUSFigs)', fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE}
```

Note that the chance of dying for a 70-year-old female was more than 4% around 1940, but it had decreased over time to a level lower than 2%. As we will see in Section \@ref(S:LifeTab), the ratio of deaths and exposures is closely related to *death rates*.

Alternatively, we can focus on a specific period -- say the most recent five years in our data, i.e. 2010-2014 -- and plot the deaths over exposures across ages as in Figure \@ref(fig:AllDRChapHMDUSFigsa)

`r HideRCode('AllDRChapHMDUSFigs',"R Code For Figure")`

```{r AllDRChapHMDUSFigs, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, comment=NA, eval=FALSE}
us_mx_fem_2014 <- us_deaths[us_deaths$Year_start == 2010,4]/us_exp[us_exp$Year_start == 2010,4]
us_mx_mal_2014 <- us_deaths[us_deaths$Year_start == 2010,5]/us_exp[us_exp$Year_start == 2010,5]
plot(us_mx_fem_2014,type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "blue", main="Deaths/Exposures", xlab = "year", ylab = "death rate", ylim = c(min(us_mx_fem_2014),max(us_mx_fem_2014)))
```

</div>

(ref:AllDRChapHMDUSFigs) **Death rates for Females across ages for 2010-2014 from the HMD U.S.**

```{r AllDRChapHMDUSFigsa, ref.label = 'AllDRChapHMDUSFigs', fig.cap = '(ref:AllDRChapHMDUSFigs)', fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE}
```

We observe that the death rate increases fairly regularly with respect to age and its growth looks exponential.  This observation is the foundation for the most famous and common analytic mortality model that is detailed in Section \@ref(S:AnalMortLaws) known as the *Gompertz law*. It should be noted that the death rates at higher ages, specifically from 106 to 110, are showing a larger variability that could be explained by the fact very small sub-populations of high ages are observed and the estimates are more uncertain than those at lower ages. 

We note some precaution when using the Human Mortality Database (HMD). It is intended to provide a wide range of interested parties with detailed and up-to-date mortality and population data covering about 41 countries. There are some countries that may exhibit different mortality patterns from these 41 countries, and these include for example, some of the most populous countries such as China, India, and Indonesia, and several countries in the African continents such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Egypt.  

### Individual Mortality Data {#S:IndivMortData}

While mortality *counts* are a common way to organize mortality data across a large population, which had been our emphasis in the previous section, the individual survival time data may provide valuable pieces of information.  Indeed, the data available to an insurance company typically consists of records of individuals.  The company records individual details for each insured person from when they purchased the contract; these include personal characteristics such as sex, age, date-of-birth, etc., but also medical records and other *underwriting information*.  In addition, the company knows whether or not the person had died at the current time---and if so, the time of death.

This latter aspect is common for *survival* or *event history data*.  For each observation (individual) $i$, a number of covariates or *features* $\textbf{x}_i$, as well as the *event time* $T_i$ *if* the event has already happened.  Otherwise, we only know that by the current *cutoff* time, the event has not happened yet. In the context of *survival analysis*, which is the branch of statistics that deals with *survival* or *event data*, this is known as *(right) censoring*, i.e. the data are (right-)censored.
 
Data protection policies are omnipresent and insurance companies are not any different with respect to policyholder data.  On one hand, there are regulatory data protection that disallow disclosure of personal identifiable pieces of information.  On the other hand, data are a key resource to a life insurer and sharing this valuable piece of information creates a competition disadvantage by revealing important information to the company's competitive position.  Therefore, rather than relying on real survival data, we consider a synthetic dataset consisting of a hypothetical portfolio of policyholders.

In the supplemental information to this text, we provide survival information for a hypothetical insurance company in `SyntheticInsurerData.csv`.  The company has sold "whole life insurance policies" for since 1955 (the coming chapters discuss different life insurance policies in detail).  Policyholders have to go through an underwriting examination, and in addition to policyholders' age, sex (0 for female, 1 for male), smoking status (0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker), and the month of sale, the company records the applicants body-mass index (BMI) and the systolic blood pressure at the time of underwriting.  Finally, for those policyholders with a claim, i.e., for the policyholders that have died, the company records the time of death (relative to the month of underwriting).  The data is organized in the order of sales, so that the oldest entries are at the top of the data and the newest entries are at the bottom:

```{r}
library(data.table)
ins_data <- fread("Data/SyntheticInsurerData.csv",data.table=FALSE)
kable(head(ins_data), align = "ccccrrrr",digits = 2)
#displaying the very end of the table similar to the very top of the table requires a few more steps
tmp_tail_ins_data <- tail(ins_data); rownames(tmp_tail_ins_data) <- NULL
kable(tmp_tail_ins_data, align = "ccccrrrr",digits = 2)
```

Evidently, most of the policies sold in the first months---back in 1955---have matured, and most recently underwritten policyholders are still alive. Let us further investigate the mortality dataframe and we start by summarizing the attributes of our data:

```{r}
suppressWarnings(library(psych))
tmp_describe_ins_data<-psych::describe(ins_data)
kable(tmp_describe_ins_data, digits = 2, format.args = list(big.mark = ","))

```
In summary, there are 160,781 insureds, out of which 59,382, i.e. 36.93%, have died; the average age at purchase is about 40, and our portfolio has a high percentage of men (70%) and non-smokers (70%).  The average BMI is 22.8 and the average blood pressure is 114.7, which are close to (but somewhat lower than) U.S. national averages; for details on common BMI and blood pressure levels, see e.g. the [Withings Health Observatory](https://obs.withings.com/us) that provides real-time information for U.S. Americans.

To illustrate the sales history, we plot the monthly sales of the company, which is given as Figure \@ref(fig:MonthlySalesFigsa).

`r HideRCode('MonthlySalesFigs',"R Code For Figure")`

```{r MonthlySalesFigs,  warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, comment=NA, eval=FALSE}
monthly_sales <- rep(0,780)
for (i in 1:780){
  monthly_sales[i] <- sum(ins_data$Month_of_Sale == i)
}
plot(monthly_sales,type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "green", main="Monthly Sales", xlab = "month", ylab = "Sales")
abline(h = mean(monthly_sales), col = "red", lty = 2)
```

</div>

(ref:MonthlySalesFigs) **Monthy sales for the synthetic mortality data**

```{r MonthlySalesFigsa, ref.label = 'MonthlySalesFigs', fig.cap = '(ref:MonthlySalesFigs)', fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE}
```

In summary, the company sells about 200 insurance contracts each month, although there is some variation over time; while sales initially increased, the company experience some ebbs and flows, potentially due to marketing efforts and/or the effectiveness or attractiveness of the products.

We now investigate the traits of the insureds for which various histograms are given as Figure \@ref(fig:HistInsDataFigsa).

`r HideRCode('HistInsDataFigs',"R Code For Figure")`

```{r HistInsDataFigs,  warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, comment=NA, eval=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
hist(ins_data$Age,main="Insured Age", xlab="age", border="red", col="green")
hist(ins_data$BMI,main="Body Mass Index", xlab="bmi", border="red", col="green")
hist(ins_data$BloodPressure,main="Systolic Blood Pressure", xlab="bp", border="red", col="green")
```

</div>

(ref:HistInsDataFigs) **Histograms  for the synthetic mortality data**

```{r HistInsDataFigsa, ref.label = 'HistInsDataFigs', fig.cap = '(ref:HistInsDataFigs)', fig.width=8, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE}
```

Most individuals are in between thirty and fifty years of age when purchasing the coverage, but some sales to younger and some older individuals are observed. The *Body Mass Index (BMI)* is concentrated between 20 and 30, although there are some outliers with relatively large values.  The systolic blood pressure is roughly bell shaped, with most applicants exhibiting blood pressure measurements  at normal levels (below 120) or slightly elevated levels (120-130). We further visualize the relationship between these three attributes by looking at the correlation correlation matrix corresponding to these three characteristics, which is given as Figure \@ref(fig:CorrPlotInsDataFigsa).

`r HideRCode('CorrPlotInsDataFigs',"R Code For Figure")`

```{r CorrPlotInsDataFigs,  warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, comment=NA, eval=FALSE}
suppressWarnings(library(corrplot))
tmp_corr_ins_data <- cor(ins_data[,c(2,5,6)])
colnames(tmp_corr_ins_data) <- c("Age", "BMI", "BP")
rownames(tmp_corr_ins_data) <- c("Age", "BMI", "BP")
corrplot(tmp_corr_ins_data, method="circle", order="hclust", addCoef.col = "red", tl.col="black",tl.srt=45)
```

</div>

(ref:CorrPlotInsDataFigs) **Correlation matrix for the synthetic mortality data corresponding to age, BMI and BP (blood pressure)**

```{r CorrPlotInsDataFigsa, ref.label = 'CorrPlotInsDataFigs', fig.cap = '(ref:CorrPlotInsDataFigs)', fig.width=10, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE}
```

Clearly, high blood pressure and elevated BMI are positively associated, and an elevated blood pressure is more common for elderly insureds, which are common observations in many populations.

One of our main focus is the realized lifetime, which can only be observed for those individuals where a claim had been paid. We thus plot the distribution of the age at death based on these observations, which is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:AgeDeathHistInsDataFigs).

```{r AgeDeathHistInsDataFigs, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap = 'Age at Death for the synthetic mortality data'}
hist(ins_data$Age+ins_data$Time_of_death,main="Age at Death", xlab="age", border="red", col="green")
```

Not surprisingly, the majority of deceased policyholders have died at higher ages, since the bulk of deaths are concentrated between seventy and ninety years old.  There are a few individuals that died relatively young, and similarly a few that were close to achieving the centenarian status, though it should be noted that some policyholders at higher ages may still be alive.  Indeed, the ages of five oldest individuals that are still alive are

```{r}
round(tail(sort(ins_data[ins_data$Claim == "NO",2]+ (780 - ins_data[ins_data$Claim == "NO",1])/12),5), digits = 2)
```

and thus, it is clear that we observe not many centenarians.

It is intuitive that the number of deaths are associated with sales: The maximal number of deaths is the number of individuals that purchased insurance. This is evident when plotting the number of deaths by the year of sale, which is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:DeathSalesPlotInsDataFigsa), particularly over the early years.

`r HideRCode('DeathSalesPlotInsDataFigs',"R Code For Figure")`

```{r DeathSalesPlotInsDataFigs, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, comment=NA, eval=FALSE} 
annual_death <- rep(0,65)
for (i in 1:65){
  for (j in 1:12){
    annual_death[i] <- annual_death[i] + sum(ins_data[ins_data$Month_of_Sale == (i-1)*12 +j,7] == "YES") 
  }
}
plot(annual_death,type = "l", lwd = 4, col = "blue", main="Annual Deaths", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Deaths")
```

</div>

(ref:DeathSalesPlotInsDataFigs) **Annual deaths for the synthetic mortality data**

```{r DeathSalesPlotInsDataFigsa, ref.label = 'DeathSalesPlotInsDataFigs', fig.cap = '(ref:DeathSalesPlotInsDataFigs)', fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE}
```

We can also investigate the relationship of the time of death to policyholder characteristics by creating a correlation plot amongst those that had already died. The correlation matrix appears as Figure \@ref(fig:DeadCorrPlotInsDataFigsa).

`r HideRCode('DeadCorrPlotInsDataFigs',"R Code For Figure")`

```{r DeadCorrPlotInsDataFigs, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, comment=NA, eval=FALSE}
#suppressWarnings(library(corrplot))
tmp_dead_corr_ins_data <- cor(ins_data[ins_data$Claim == "YES",c(2,5,6,8)])
colnames(tmp_dead_corr_ins_data) <- c("Age", "BMI", "BP", "TD")
rownames(tmp_dead_corr_ins_data) <- c("Age", "BMI", "BP", "TD")
corrplot(tmp_dead_corr_ins_data, method="circle", order="hclust", addCoef.col = "red", tl.col="black", tl.srt=45)
```

</div>

(ref:DeadCorrPlotInsDataFigs) **Correlation matrix for the synthetic mortality data corresponding to age, BMI, BP (blood pressure) and TD (time of death)**

```{r DeadCorrPlotInsDataFigsa, ref.label = 'DeadCorrPlotInsDataFigs', fig.cap = '(ref:DeadCorrPlotInsDataFigs)', fig.width=10, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE}
```

Hence, the time of death is (strongly) negatively associated with age, which is not surprising as elderly individuals are more likely to die.  Similar behaviour is also observed for the BMI and blood pressure attributes that are negatively associated with the the time of death, but we should clarify that the  BMI and blood pressure measurements are observed at policy inception though these negative associations explain why such attributes are good predictors of the insured's health. The pairwise correlation between age, BMI and blood pressure are in line with our findings from Figure \@ref(fig:CorrPlotInsDataFigsa) that includes all insureds irrespective of their life status.

Even this simple analysis helps in understanding why the life office should evaluate the individual risk per policy by taking into consideration the available information, and more importantly, to have a fair evaluation of the covariates with strong influence over the policy final payout.
 
## Modeling Death {#Sec:ModelingDeaths}

The previous section has introduced various examples of mortality data. Clearly, the most relevant question to actuaries is how to use the available pieces of information in order to devise lifetime models that could become the basis for analyzing the life contingent exposures. This section provides the theoretical foundation for modeling lifetimes. 

An important caveat is that we focus, both in the presentation of the datasets and in the modeling considerations in this chapter, on understanding the *lifetime uncertainty* for a given individual or (sub)population, where the life status is assumed to be dichotomous, i.e. *alive* and *dead* are the only life status under observation. Clearly, this simplified assumption helps us to create a parsimonious presentation that is fit for its purpose at this very moment, though one could consider *multi-state models* -- with multiple life status such as alive, death, temporary disability, permanent disability and any other long term health condition, etc. -- or *models with multiple decrements* that relate to specific life insurance products where the modeler could consider non-health related factors such as early termination of a contract that have an impact on the policy's cashflows. Clearly multi-state and multi-decrement models present a generalization of the dichotomous lifetime model, where there are only two states -- alive and dead -- and a single decrement -- dying, respectively. However, aside from being an important special case, there are benefits to discussing and building such more general models armed with the understanding of and experience working with the dichotomous model. We will return to multi-decrement and multi-state models in Chapter XX.

We commence by introducing the most important concept of a lifetime random variable and then discuss key actuarial quantities that allow for a formal interpretation of the data previously presented. We deviate from a traditional actuarial presentation in that we allow for general attributes, which we denote by $\bf{x}$, to affect the lifetime distribution. However, towards the end of the section, we specialize to the more limited -- but in traditional actuarial modeling conventional 
-- assumption that the only relevant (dynamic) covariate for the distribution of the lifetimes is age $x$.

### Lifetime Random Variable and its Distribution

We start by considering an individual with attributes $\bf{x}$ from some feature space. We assume that the attributes $\bf{x}$ are sufficient to determine the distribution of the individual's future lifetime, which we denote by $T_{\bf{x}}$. In other words, the *lifetime random variable* $T_{\bf{x}}$ follows a distribution depending on the attributes $\bf{x}$. We will assume this random variable has positive real values, i.e. its support is $(0,\infty)$, and that the random variable is "well-behaved" (integrable, continuous, etc.) so that all the operations in what follows are well-defined.

It is helpful to pause and reflect on different types of possible attributes. Some attributes, such as the individual's race, the individual's (biological) sex, race, learned profession, etc., are immutable. Thus, one can either include them in the considered set of attributes $\bf{x}$. *Or* we can consider a population of individuals with the same immutable characteristics, and then differentiate them solely by non-immutable characteristics $\bf{x}$. An example are the life expectancy tables in Section \@ref(S:DataLifeExp): here the relevant population could be hispanic females, for which we distinguished (only) different age levels. This approach, where *age* -- typically denoted by $x$ -- is the only attribute under consideration, is the setting contemplated in traditional life-contingent analysis, and we will discuss this as an important special case in the last part  \@ref(S:ModelOnlyAge) of this section.

However, the latter setting is restrictive from a number of perspectives. For instance, there are various individual characteristics that are relevant to the future lifetime that are non-immutable. For instance, the health-related attributes of BMI and systolic blood pressure in the dataset presented in Section \@ref(S:IndivMortData) may change over time, and a blood pressure level of 130 for a 30 year old may carry a different interpretation than a level of 130 for a 70 year old. Moreover, environmental or socio-economic conditions may change over time and could impact the distribution of future lifetimes, and these could also be reflected in the set of attributes $\bf{x}$. We leave the exploration of different relevant examples to the remaining sections of this chapter as well as later, more advanced chapters of this book. 

Let $F_{\bf{x}}$ and $S_{\bf{x}}$ be the *cumulative distribution function* (cdf) and *survival function* of $T_{\bf{x}}$, respectively:
$$
F_{\bf{x}}(t) =\Pr(T_{\bf{x}}\le t)\quad \text{and}\quad S_{\bf{x}}(t) =\Pr(T_{\bf{x}} > t)=1-\Pr(T_{\bf{x}} \le t)=1-F_{\bf{x}}(t)\quad\text{for all}\;t\geq0.
$$

Given our natural assumption that the lifetime variable $T_{\bf{x}}$ is continuously distributed, i.e. that there are no outcomes that carry point masses, we can also defined its probability density function $f_{\bf{x}}$: 

$$
f_{\bf{x}}(t) =\frac{\partial F_{\bf{x}}(t)}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial \big(1- S_{\bf{x}}(t)\big)}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial S_{\bf{x}}(t)}{\partial t},\;t\geq 0.
$$

Similarly, we can define the *force of mortality*, $\mu_\bf{x}$, which in different contexts is also referred to as the *hazard rate* or the *mortality intensity*:

$$
\mu_{\bf{x}}(t) = - \frac{\partial \log\{ S_{\bf{x}}(t)\}}{\partial t} = \frac{-\frac{\partial S_{\bf{x}}(t)}{\partial t}}{S_{\bf{x}}(t)}=\frac{f_{\bf{x}}(t)}{S_{\bf{x}}(t)},\;t\geq 0,
$$

which is equivalent to:
$$
S_{\bf{x}}(t) = \exp\left\{-\int_0^t \mu_{\bf{x}}(s)\;ds \right\}\quad\text{for all}\quad t\ge 0.
$$
The important point to note is that any one of the functions $F_{\bf{x}}$, $S_{\bf{x}}$, $f_{\bf{x}}$, or $\mu_{\bf{x}}$ completely determines the distribution of the future lifetime $T_{\bf{x}}$. In other words, in order to specify a probabilistic model of future lifetimes, we can choose to model any of these quantities -- knowing the form of just one of them will allow you to determine expressions for the other functions.

### Standard Actuarial Notation: $q_{\bf{x}}$, $_tp_{\bf{x}}$, and All That  

The introduction of the lifetime random variable, in principle, is enough for actuarial analyses of life-contingent exposures. In particular, as we will see in the next chapter, based on $T_{\bf{x}}$ we can model (discounted) cash flows of common life insurance and annuity products, determine their expected values and variances, etc. However, the discussion so far was primarily formal and did not instill much intuition. For instance, the cdf $F_{\bf{x}}(t)$ at time $t$ is nothing else than the probability that an individual will die before a certain time $t$, i.e. the *mortality probability*; and the expected value of $T_{\bf{x}}$ is nothing else than the expected years lived, i.e. the *life expectancy*, for an individual with attributes $\bf{x}$ that we had already encountered in Section \@ref(S:DataLifeExp) in the context of national vital statistics.

To instill interpretation into the notation, but also to have a precise, uniform representation to record and communicate relevant quantities, actuaries around the globe rely on so-called [standard actuarial notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_notation). This notation is based on a so-called *Halo* system where symbols are placed as superscript or subscript before or after a main character.  In particular, the $t$-year *mortality probability* for an individual with attributes $\bf{x}$ is denotes by $_tq_{\bf{x}}$:
$$
{_tq_{\bf{x}}} = F_{\bf{x}}(t),\;t\geq 0.
$$
Similarly the $t$-year *survival probability*, denoted by $_tp_{\bf{x}}$, is nothing else than the survival function:
$$
{_tp_{\bf{x}}} = S_{\bf{x}}(t),\;t\geq 0.
$$
Clearly, ${_tp_{\bf{x}}}+{_tq_{\bf{x}}}=1$, since the individual $x$ either dies or survives after $t$ units of time. Furthermore, is is conventional to drop a superscript of one:
$$
{_1p_{\bf{x}}} = {p_{\bf{x}}}\quad\text{and}\quad {_1q_{\bf{x}}} = {q_{\bf{x}}}.
$$
Furthemore, we denote the $s$-year mortality probability after surviving for $t$ years as:
$$
{_{t|s}q_{\bf{x}}} = F_{\bf{x}}(t+s) - F_{\bf{x}}(t) = {_{t+s}q_{\bf{x}}} - {_tq_{\bf{x}}} = S_{\bf{x}}(t) - S_{\bf{x}}(t+s) = {_tp_{\bf{x}}} - {_{t+s}p_{\bf{x}}} ,\;t,s\geq 0.
$$

As indicated, the expected value of the lifetime random variable corresponds to the *(complete) expectation of life* or *life expectancy*. It is defined as follows:

$$
\stackrel{\circ}{e}_{\bf{x}}=E[T_{\bf{x}}]=\int_0^\infty t \,f_{\bf{x}}(t)\;dt=\int_0^\infty {_tp_{\bf{x}}}\;dt,
$$
where the last equaility follows from integration by parts.

`r HideProofTheory('DerivationLifeExp',"Derivation of Formula for Complete Life Expectancy")`

$$
\stackrel{\circ}{e}_{\bf{x}} = E[T_{\bf{x}}] = \int_0^{\infty} t\, \underbrace{f_{\bf{x}}(t)}_{-S_{\bf{x}}'(t)}\,dt = - \left[S_{\bf{x}}(t)\, t\right]_{t=0}^{\infty} + \int_0^{\infty} S_{\bf{x}}(t)\,dt = \int_0^{\infty} {_tp_{\bf{x}}}\,dt.
$$

</div>

It is also helpful to define a *temporary* version of the expectation of life, i.e. the number of years lived wihin the next $n$ years. In actuarial notation, temporary quantities are denoted by $\cdot_{\cdot:\overline{n}|}$:
$$
\stackrel{\circ}{e}_{{\bf{x}}:\overline{n}|} = E[\min\{T_{\bf{x}},n\}] = \int_0^{n} {_tp_{\bf{x}}}\,dt.
$$
The interpretation is that unlike for the complete expectation of life, we only count years lived until time $n.$ For instance, considering a population of $l_0$ individuals, while $l_0 \times {_tp_{\bf{x}}}$ denotes the expected number of survivors until time $t$, $l_0 \times \stackrel{\circ}{e}_{{\bf{x}}:\overline{t}|}$ denotes the average size of the population over the next $t$ periods. We will return to this point in the context of life tables in section \@ref(S:LifeTab).

We will see many more examples of actuarial notation through the course of this book, and we will heavily rely on it.

### The Classical Case: Age-Only Model {#S:ModelOnlyAge}

As mentioned, an important special case is the situation where the only (non-immutable) attribute is age. In this case, it is conventional to write ${\bf{x}} = x$, where $x$ is a number denoting current age, and the lifetime random variable $T_x$ that explains the remaining future lifetime for an individual currently aged $x$. Hence, in this case, $T_x$ -- and its distribution -- solely depends on the age $x$, and, thus, $T_x$ and $T_0|T_0>x$ are identically distributed random variables (here $T_0|T_0>x$ denotes the random variable conditional on the event $\{T_0>x\}$). In other words, the future lifetime for $(x)$ is the same as the future lifetime of a newborn given that this newborn reaches age $x$, $T_0>x$. 

The mathematical formulations are thus described by conditional probabilities:
\begin{eqnarray*}
{_tq_x} = F_x(t) &=& Pr(T_x \le t) = Pr(T_x \le t \mid T_x>0) \\
&=& Pr(T_0-x \le t \mid T_0-x>0) = Pr(T_0 \le x + t \mid T_0 > x)\\
&=&\frac{\Pr(x<T_0\leq x+t)}{\Pr(T_0>x)}=\frac{F_0(x+t)-F_0(x)}{S_0(x)}=\frac{S_0(x)-S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}
\end{eqnarray*}
and
\begin{eqnarray*}
{_tp_x} = S_x(t) &=& Pr(T_x > t) = Pr(T_x > t \mid T_x > 0) \\
&=& Pr(T_0-x > t \mid T_0-x>0) =  Pr(T_0 > x+t \mid T_0>x)\\
&=&\frac{\Pr(T_0> x+t)}{\Pr(T_0>x)}=\frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Similarly, the probability density function of $T_x$ is simply given by the conditional density function of $T_0$:
$$
f_x(t)=-\frac{\partial S_x(t)}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial \left(\frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}\right)}{\partial t}=-\frac{\frac{\partial S_0(x+t)}{\partial t}}{S_0(x)}=\frac{f_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}\quad\text{for all}\;t>0.
$$
and the force of mortality:
$$
\mu_x(t) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \log\{S_x(t)\} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \log\{S_0(x+t)\} = \mu_0(x+t) = \mu_{x+t},
$$
i.e. it depends on current age only.

Given the formula for the survival probability, we have:
$$
{_tp_x} = \frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)} = \frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x+s)} \frac{S_0(x+s)}{S_0(x)} = \frac{S_0(x+s + (t-s))}{S_0(x+s)} \frac{S_0(x+s)}{S_0(x)} = {_{t-s}p_{x+s}}\,{_sp_x},
$$
i.e. survival probabilities factorize into subperiod survival probabilities in this case. This is one of the key properties that does *not* hold in the general situation for ${_tp_{\bf{x}}}$  from the previous section, but simplifies expressions in this "age-only" model. For instance, we obtain for the $s$-year mortality probability after surviving for $t$ years as:
$$
{_{t|s}q_{x}} =  {_tp_x} - {_{t+s}p_x} =  {_tp_x}\, (1 - {_sp_{x+t}}) = {_tp_x}\,{_sq_{x+t}},\;t,s\geq 0.
$$
As for another example, we can express the $n$-year temporary life expectancy for an $x$-year old as a function of complete life expectancies at ages $x$ and $x+n$, and the survival probability:
$$
\stackrel{\circ}{e}_{x:\overline{n}|} = \stackrel{\circ}{e}_{x}-{_np_x}\,\stackrel{\circ}{e}_{x+n}.
$$

`r HideProofTheory('FormTempLifeExp',"Derivation of Relationship for Temporary Life Expectancy")`

$$
\stackrel{\circ}{e}_{x:\overline{n}|} = \int_0^{n} {_tp_x}\,dt = \int_0^{\infty} {_tp_x}\,dt - \int_n^{\infty} {_tp_x}\,dt = \stackrel{\circ}{e}_{x} - {_np_x}\,\int_n^{\infty} {_{t-n}p_{x+n}}\,dt = \stackrel{\circ}{e}_{x} - {_np_x}\,\int_0^{\infty} {_{t}p_{x+n}}\,dt = \stackrel{\circ}{e}_{x}-{_np_x}\,\stackrel{\circ}{e}_{x+n}.
$$

</div>

Some of the most common models for future lifetimes fall in this category of "age-only models," in particular the most common *analytical mortality laws* that we will encounter in the next section as well as models based on conventional life tables (see Section \@ref(S:LifeTab)) -- both of which are very common in actuarial analysis. While the idea of age being the sole co-variate appears limiting, recall the note from above that one could view the model as specific to a certain population with the same immutable characteristics. Indeed, sometimes it is helpful to carry immutable characteristics as an additional subscript, say ${\bf{x}}=(x,a)$ where $a$ is immutable. Here, the same considerations apply as in the "age-only model," e.g. we have: 
$$
{_tp_{(x,a)}} = {_{t-s}p_{(x+s,a)}}\,{_sp_{(x,a)}},
$$
We will encounter similar models and notation in the context of *select-and-ultimate life tables* or in the context of *cohort life tables* in Section \@ref(S:LifeTab). That said, approaches that allow for individual attributes affecting the future lifetime distribution as survival regression models that we will discuss in Section \@ref(S:SurvReg) as well as models that incorporate a stochastic evolution of mortality rates due to uncertainty in the demographic environment or in medical technology do not fall in this class of "age-only models," but are covered by our more general approach and notation. 

Obviously, in order to make the model accurate, it should include all possible sources of data and their attributes that could better differentiate the mortality risk amongst insureds or in other words, to achieve equity in the pricing process. However, the choice of an appropriate model also depends on context and potential restrictions. For example, the use of genetic specific attributes for risk classification is under vast scrutiny by insurance ethical experts, since such pieces of information could lead to genetic discrimination, and therefore, there are regulatory constraints in using such attributes. Moreover, even the (biological) sex attribute -- one of the most important mortality explanatory variable -- is not always acceptable; for example, the European Union insurance regulations had imposed pricing neutrality with respect to sex factors for quite some time, which means that life and non-life insurance policies issued within the European Union market should price males and females at the same level if all other observable attributes are similar. 

We will return to such considerations in future chapters when contemplating instututional aspects of certain insurance products or services. In the remainder of this chapter, we will discuss the most common mortality models, i.e. ways of characterizing the distribution of $T_{\bf{x}}$. In particular, in addition to its specification, we will also comment on statistical estimation of the resulting model.

## Analytical laws of mortality {#S:AnalMortLaws}

Actuarial practice relies on extensive mortality experience based on non-parametric and semi-parametric models. Early on mortality modeling had focused on simplified parametric models that depend on some parameters and are known as *Analytic Mortality Laws*; such models assume analytic survival or mortality functions, which have their own merits though the lack of sophistication is easily visible. From the pedagogical perspective, some of these analytical laws of mortality may be good toy models that provide simple approximations of reality, which is the essence of any model. These models are typically relatively simple and fall in the category of "age-only" models from Section \@ref(S:ModelOnlyAge), so that a suitable interpretatuion is that the model describes the mortality of a specific population.

### De Moivre and Constant Force Models

Starting with the simplest approach, it is clear that any survival function takes the value 1 and 0 at the left and right end point of its distribution. Thus, if a newborn is assumed to have a known limited age $\omega$, then $S_0(0)=1$ and $S_0(\omega)=0$. One simple analytical example is the *De Moivre Mortality Law* which assumes a linear dependence of $S_0$, i.e.
$$
S_0(x) = 1 - \frac{x}{\omega}\quad\text{for all}\quad 0 \leq x \leq \omega.
$$
Now, the force of mortality becomes
$$
\mu_x= \frac{-S_0'(x)}{S_0(x)} = \frac{\frac{1}{\omega}}{1 - \frac{x}{\omega}} = \frac{1}{\omega - x}\quad\text{for all}\quad 0 \leq x < \omega.
$$
It should be noted that if the lifetime distribution of a newborn follows *De Moivre Mortality Law*, then once the newborn reaches a certain age $x$, the new lifetime distribution also follows *De Moivre*, with a parameterization replacing $\omega$ with $\omega -x$.

A generalization of the above analytical mortality law is known as the *generalized De Moivre Law*, and corresponds to a survival function with the following parametrization
$$
S_0(x) = \left(1 - \frac{x}{\omega}\right)^{\alpha}\quad\text{for all}\quad 0\leq x \leq \omega,
$$
where the positive shape parameter $\alpha$ decides how far the survival function departs from the linear dependence. Then, its force of mortality becomes
$$
\mu_x = \frac{\alpha/\omega\,(1-x/\omega)^{\alpha-1}}{(1-x/\omega)^{\alpha}} = \frac{\alpha}{\omega - x}\quad\text{for all}\quad 0\leq x \leq \omega.
$$
Future lifetime distribution is also preserved with *generalized De Moivre Law*. For a newborn with mortality that follows this law, the future lifetime distribution, upon reaching a particular age $x$, also follows *generalized De Moivre Law*. The $\alpha$ parameter is preserved but as in *De Moivre Mortality Law*, parameter $\omega$ is replaced with $\omega -x$.

As indicated, a different approach is to impose a particular structure to the force of mortality.  The simplest example is to consider a constant force of mortality model, i.e. $\mu_t=\mu$ for all $t>0$, which corresponds to an Exponentially distributed lifetime $T_x$ with
$$
S_0(x) = e^{-\mu\,x}\quad\text{for all}\quad x\ge 0.
$$
Note that this *constant force mortality model* does not square with the idea the mortality is increasing over time, which makes it a poor candidate for modeling human mortality -- although it may be a suitable candidate of modeling the death of certain populations or failure of non-organisms. For the *De Moivre* and *generalized De Moivre* mortality laws, we do observe an increasing force of mortality, although the hyperbolic relationship also does not match typical patterns of human mortality.

### Gompertz and Makeham Laws

In contrast, a candidate that is able to better depict human mortality is provided by the *Gompertz Mortality Law* and is given as follows:
$$
\mu_x = B\cdot c^x \quad\text{for all}\quad x\ge 0\quad\text{with}\quad B>0,\,c>1.
$$
Its survival function becomes

$$
S_0(x) =\exp\left\{-\int_0^x \mu_t\;dt \right\}=\exp\left\{-\int_0^x B\cdot c^t\;dt \right\}=\exp\left\{-\frac{B \cdot c^t}{\log c}\Big\lvert_{t=0}^{t=x} \right\} =\exp\left\{ - \frac{B}{\log(c)} (c^x - 1)\right\}\quad\text{for all}\quad x\ge 0. 
$$
A three parameter version of the *Gompertz Mortality Law* was proposed by Makeham, where an age-independent term is added and captures the external causes of death, i.e.

$$
\mu_x = A + B\cdot c^x\quad\text{for all}\quad x\ge 0\quad\text{with}\quad B>0,\,A+B\geq 0,\,c>1,
$$
and is known as the *Gompertz-Makeham Mortality Law* or *Makeham Mortality Law*. Then, its survival function could be derived as follows: 

\begin{eqnarray*}
S_0(x) &=&  \exp\left\{-\int_0^x \mu_t\,dt\right\}\\
&=& \exp\left\{-\int_0^x A\,dt\right\}\,\exp\left\{-\int_0^x B\cdot c^t\,dt\right\}\\
&= & \exp\{-A x\}\,\exp\left\{ - \frac{B}{\log(c)} (c^x - 1)\right\} \\
&=& \exp\left\{ - Ax - \frac{B}{\log(c)} (c^x - 1)\right\}.
\end{eqnarray*}

### Makeham Law based on Life Expectancies Data

The Gompertz-Makeham mortality model is sufficiently rich to represent typical patterns in human mortality. To have workable models for applications for the remainder of the book, we fit the model to our life expectancy data from Section \@ref(S:DataLifeExp). 

Formally, we interpret the given life expectancies as (generalized) *moments* of our model, and then rely on the (generalized) *methods of moments* (GMM) to pin down the model parameters. We omit statistical details behind GMM (see e.g. [this introduction](https://www.ksh.hu/statszemle_archive/2012/2012_K16/2012_K16_150.pdf) for more details), but intuitively we determine the model parameters that produce model moments that are closest, in the least-squares sense, to the given data. We can then appraise the model fit by analyzing how close the fitted model moments are to the actual moments.

In doing so, we `R` define functions that determine the survival functions and the life expectancy at a given age $x$, where we evaluate the associated integral numerically. We then run a numerical optimization procedure that determines the parameters that best approximate the empirical moments.

`r HideRCode('GompertzEst_code',"R Code For Estimating the Gompert model")`

```{r}
S_0 <- function(x,A,B,c) { exp(- A * x - B * (exp(c*x) - 1)/ c) }

le <- function(age,A,B,c){
  Sfixed <- function(x){ S_0(x+age,A,B,c)/S_0(age,A,B,c)}
  res <- integrate(Sfixed,lower = 0, upper = (120-age))$value
  return(res)
}
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# We just use the resulting parameters here and do not carry out the following routine.

tomin <- function(x){
  res <- 0
  for (i in 1:5){
    res <- res + (us_les[i,4] - le((i-1)*20,0.0001*(1+x[1]/100),0.000007*(1+x[2]/100),0.11*(1+x[3]/100)))^2
  }
  return(res)
}
library(pracma)
res <- fminsearch(tomin,c(0,0,0))
A_opt_fem <- A*(1+res$xmin[1]/100)
B_opt_fem <- B*(1+res$xmin[2]/100)
c_opt_fem <- c*(1+res$xmin[3]/100)
```

c <- c(0.1031558,0.09276854)

```

</div>

Here are the resulting parameters:
```{r}
kable(MakehamUS, digits = 7, format.args = list(big.mark = ","))
```
which match the U.S. life expectancies quite well. For instance, for the female life expectancies we obtain:
```{r}
tmp <- us_les[,c(1,4)]
tmp$fitted <- rep(0,5)
for (i in 1:5){
  tmp[i,3] <- le((i-1)*20,MakehamUS$A[1],MakehamUS$B[1],MakehamUS$c[1])

## Life tables and their functions {#S:LifeTab}

Life insurance policies have a complex benefit structure that requires knowledge upon the probability of paying the benefits besides many other risk modeling parameters. Policy pricing, meeting the regulatory requirements and understanding the life portfolio risk performance are all actuarial evaluations that rely on these risk modeling parameters, but the mortality risk plays an important role for which sophisticated stochastic models are possible.  A rather simpler way is to construct *life tables* that are not only of pedagogical use, but create a simplified platform of discussions for a smooth transition to understanding more complex mortality models. 

We first start with creating some simple life tables in Section \@ref(S:LifeTabBasic) that are based on the U.S. mortality data, and we then move on into Section \@ref(S:LifeTabMImpr) that provides some refinements of these life tables.

### Life table based on U.S. population data {#S:LifeTabBasic}

The central focus of this section is to create some simple life tables and to validate our empirical results by revealing the main traits of a generic mortality data. The U.S. population data are only included in our analysis, and we start by looking into *central death rates* based on deaths and exposures.  Before giving the summary results, here are some oh these computation are made; by looking at the main data from `HMD_Expo.csv` and `HMD_Deaths.csv`, one could retrieve the 1935-1939 exposures and deaths for individuals aged 0 as follows: 

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{lccc}
	            &\text{Female}	  &   \text{Male}	  &     \text{Total}\\
\text{Exposures}& 	4,869,267.21 &	5,057,569.27	& 9,926,836.48\\
\text{Deaths}    &    253,145.89	&  335,492	     & 588,637.89
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
$$

The above could help with finding the corresponding 1935-1939 central death rates for the female, male and entire U.S. population data, and the calculations are given below:

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
m_o^{Female}&=&\frac{253,145.89}{4,869,267.21}=0.05198849828\\ 
m_o^{Male}&=&\frac{335,492}{5,057,569.27}=0.06633463272\\
m_o^{Total}&=&\frac{588,637.89}{9,926,836.48}=0.05929763134.
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

We could now provide the summary of the central death rates as follows: 

```{r}
library(data.table)
us_mx <- us_deaths 
us_mx[,4:6] <- us_deaths[,4:6] / us_exp[,4:6]
kable(head(us_mx), align = "cccrrr")
#displaying the very end of the table similar to the very top of the table requires a few more steps
tmp_tail_us_mx <- tail(us_mx); rownames(tmp_tail_us_mx) <- NULL
kable(tmp_tail_us_mx, align = "cccrrr")
```

Another centrality mortality measure is the *central death rate*, also known as *central rate of mortality*. This measure is defined as the average number of deaths each year that have characteristics $\bf{x}$ at the moment of death in the relevant observation period, divided by the average population with the same characteristics $\bf{x}$ over the same period, and is denoted as $m_\bf{x}$. In practice, the observation period could be three to five years. For example, if we consider the U.S. mortality data, $m_{50}$ based on the observation period 2010 to 2014 would be the average number of deaths at age $50$ years across 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, divided by the average number of people aged $50$ years across 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014; clearly, this example considers that age is the only explanatory variable to the mortality risk. 

Based on the five year counting of deaths and exposures, we have displayed only the early ages central death rates based on the first period of observation, i.e. 1935-1939, and the upper higher ages central death rates based on the last period of observation, i.e. 2010-2014. The data show the expected trend that females show lower rates than the males.  Moreover, besides the infantile mortality, all low ages death rates follow a decreasing pattern with respect to the age factor, which is also observable for high ages with the caveat that a higher uncertainty is present at such ages due to the relative smaller sample size. 

Let's now construct a mortality life table using the 2010-2014 U.S. Females and Males data, and we first pull out the previous pieces of information regarding to the 2010-2014 central death rates, which are only the first elements of these two life table.

```{r}
us_mx_fem_2014 <- us_mx[us_mx$Year_start == 2010,-c(2,5,6)]
colnames(us_mx_fem_2014)[colnames(us_mx_fem_2014)=="Female"] <- "mx US Females"
tmp_head_us_mx_fem_2014 <- head(us_mx_fem_2014); rownames(tmp_head_us_mx_fem_2014) <- NULL
kable(head(tmp_head_us_mx_fem_2014), align = "ccr")
```

```{r}
us_mx_mal_2014 <- us_mx[us_mx$Year_start == 2010,-c(2,4,6)]
colnames(us_mx_mal_2014)[colnames(us_mx_mal_2014)=="Male"] <- "mx US Males"
tmp_head_us_mx_mal_2014 <- head(us_mx_mal_2014); rownames(tmp_head_us_mx_mal_2014) <- NULL
kable(head(tmp_head_us_mx_mal_2014), align = "ccr")
```

```
Similar pictorial representations for the U.S. Males data appear in Figure \@ref(fig:QxUSMalDataFigs).

```{r QxUSMalDataFigs, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.cap = 'One year death probability curve (in blue) and central death rate (in red) for the 2010-2014 U.S. Males data across all ages'}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
us_mx_mal_2014$qx <- 1-exp(-us_mx_mal_2014$mx)
plot(us_mx_mal_2014$qx,type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "blue", main="Original scale", xlab = "age", ylab = "q_x",ylim = c(0,1.0))
lines(us_mx_mal_2014$mx,col="red")
plot(log(us_mx_mal_2014$qx, base = 10),type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "blue", main="Log scale", xlab = "age", ylab = "q_x")
```
As we can see, $q_x$ and $m_x$ are similar with the exception of the later years, which is not surprising since $1-e^{-y}\approx y$ for $y$ sufficiently small and by keeping on mind that the central death rates are small at all ages except of high ages. As expected, the log scale plots from Figures \@ref(fig:QxUSFemDataFigs) and \@ref(fig:QxUSMalDataFigs) are more informative in the sense that the log scale reveals the marginal changes over various ages, and we now combined the two log scaled curves into Figure \@ref(fig:QxUSFemMalDataFigs).

```{r QxUSFemMalDataFigs, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap = 'One year death probability curve for the 2010-2014 U.S. Females (in blue) and Males (in red) data across all ages'}
plot(log(us_mx_fem_2014$qx, base = 10), type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "blue", main="Log scale", xlab = "age", ylab = "q_x")
lines(log(us_mx_mal_2014$qx, base = 10), lwd = 5, col = "red")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:QxUSFemMalDataFigs) shows the usual higher mortality rates for males than for females, but also extremely pronounced differences at ages 16 to 40 that could be explained by social factors that are specific to U.S. Males at post adolescence ages; moreover, significant differences at ages 50 to 70 are also observed, and are due to health related factors that males around the world tend to be exposed earlier than females.  

We are now able to construct life tables based on the U.S. mortality data, but we first provide a brief introduction to the concept of life tables. A *life table* contains various pieces of information about the mortality risk exhibit by individuals from a targeted age span; death of survivorship elements are displayed based on the observational data. More specific mortality rates due to seasonal epidemics, disability, etc., are usually not included. More complex life tables could be produced for multi-state models that we mentioned before, and are known as *multi-state life table*.  

A life table is known as *period life table* if the prevalence rates -- useful for health related causes of decrement -- or mortality rates are observed during a specific time period of a certain population. On the contrary,  a *cohort life table* is generated by collating these rates from a specific population observed over its entire lifetime, i.e. from early birth -- all individuals are assumed to be born during the same time period -- until the observational group is extincted. Both life tables have their own merits, but the cohort life tables tend to be more popular in the actuarial practice
and demography, since mortality experts are particularly interested into understanding the mortality patterns within subpopulations for actuarial calculations and advising the economic and social policy-makers. Given our available U.S. mortality data, we are only able to provide period life tables.

Our life table examples are given for a dichotomous mortality model with dead/alive possible life status for which age and sex are the only focal mortality explanatory variables. We restrict to the 2010-2014 U.S. mortality data and display the death probabilities, i.e. $q_x$'s, central death rate, i.e. $m_x$'s and $l_x$'s for a given life table *radix*, i.e. $l_0$; these are displayed for all ages, but separately for females and males when $l_0$ is chosen to be 1,000,000, which is an ad-hoc choice though other choices like 100,000 would be possible as well. One could view the third elements of our life table, i.e. $l_x$, as the expected number of individuals at risk with characteristics $x$, which is purely the age in this case given that the data are already separated by sex. Therefore, we have that

$$
_tp_x=\frac{l_{x+t}}{l_x}\quad\text{for all}\quad x,t\ge0,
$$

which in turn leads

$$
l_{x+1}=l_x\cdot p_x=l_x\big(1-q_x\big)\approx l_x\cdot e^{-m_x}\quad\text{for all integers}\quad x.
$$

under the constant force of mortality assumption. For example, 

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{array}{lllll}
l_0^{Female}&=&l_0\big(1-q_0^{Female}\big)&\approx& l_0\cdot \exp\big(-m_0^{Female}\big)&=&1,000,000\cdot e^{-0.005461737}&=& 994,553.151168\\
l_0^{Male}  &=&l_0\big(1-q_0^{Male}\big)  &\approx& l_0\cdot \exp\big(-m_0^{Male}\big)  &=&1,000,000\cdot e^{-0.006554279}&=& 993,467.153436,
\end{array}
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

which are quite close to the exact values 994,553.151225 and 993,467.1533967, respectively that are displayed on the actual life tables that follow after Figure \@ref(fig:LxMalFemDataFigs). The $l_x$ values are now plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:LxMalFemDataFigs) where once again the female subpopulation shows higher survivorship trend than the male subpopulation.

```{r, LxMalFemDataFigs, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap = 'Expected number at risk for the 2010-2014 U.S. Females (in yellow) and Males (in orange) data across all ages'}

We could use these life tables to obtain other death/survival related projections such as the newborn survival probabilities curves, which appears in Figure \@ref(fig:P0USFemMalDataFigs).

```{r P0USFemMalDataFigs,  fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.cap = 'One year death probability curve for newborn Femals (left) and Males (right) for the 2010-2014 U.S. data across all ages'}

kP0m <- us_mx_mal_2014$lm/us_mx_mal_2014$l[1]
plot(kP0m, xlab="age", type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "green")
```

$\color{red}{\text{[Vali:] I assume that the next calculation is based on the following integral aproximation $\stackrel{\circ}{e}_x\approx 0.5+e_x$?}}$

$\color{red}{\text{[Vali:] Some calculations neeed the kurtate future lifetime $e_x$ which I thought that would be defined by Adam and Emil.}}$

$\color{red}{\text{[Vali:] No changes are made in this subsection from this point.}}$

$\color{red}{\text{[Vali:] The flow of the chapter is not ideal, especially the CF assumption.}}$

Life expectancy:

```{r}
sum(kP0f) - 0.5
```

And we can do the same for a 50-year-old female:

```{r}
kP50 <- us_mx_fem_2014$l[51:111]/us_mx_fem_2014$l[51]
plot(kP50,xlab="age", type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "red")
```


Let's go through and evaluate period life expectancies at birth and at 50 across the years.  This is a little more involved:

```{r}
e0 <- rep(0,16)
e50 <- rep(0,16)

plot(kP0f,xlab="age", type = "l", col = 1)

i <- 1

for (s in seq(1935,2010,5)){
  #Get central death rates for each start yeat
  mx <- us_mx[us_mx$Year_start == s,4]
  s0 <- rep(0,111)
  
  #Calculate the survival function
  s0[1] <- 1
  for (j in 2:111){
    s0[j] <- s0[j-1]*exp(-mx[j-1])
  }
  
  #Include in the plot
  lines(s0, col=(i+1))
  
  #And evaluate life expectancies by summing over kPx's
  e0[i] <- sum(s0)-0.5
  e50[i] <- sum(s0[51:111]/s0[51])-0.5
  i <- i+1
}
```

As is evident, the survival function has shifted quite dramatically over the past eighty years.  The same is true for life expectancies:

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(seq(1935,2010,5),e0, type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "blue", main="life expectancies at birth, across years", xlab = "year", ylab = "life expectancy")
plot(seq(1935,2010,5),e50, type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "red", main="life expectancies at 50, across years", xlab = "year", ylab = "life expectancy")
```

### Fractional year assumptions

The second elements of our life tables require computing the annual death probabilities $q_x$ from $m_x$ for which some background information is needed. An intuitive definition of the central death rate is given in Section \@ref(S:LifeExp), which is the ratio between the expected deaths and average population within a given observation period.  A more mathematical formulation is possible when the reference period is reduced to one year for a population of 1, and is given as follows:  
$$
m_{\bf{x}}:=\frac{E[I_{T_{\bf{x}}\le1}]}{E\big[\min\big(T_{\bf{x}},1\big)\big]},
$$
where $I_{\cdot}$ is the indicator function for which $I_A$ takes the values 1 and 0 if $A$ is true and false, respectively. The nominator represents the theoretical expected deaths since

Note that the first identity could be shown via integration by parts. Finally, combining altogether gives that

$$
m_{\bf{x}}=\frac{q_{\bf{x}}}{\int_0^1 {_tp_{\bf{x}}}\;dt}.
$$

Annual death probabilities could be estimated on observed central death rates by making some fractional age assumptions. One simple fractional age assumption considers a constant force of mortality over the period of interest, i.e. one year since we compute the one year death rates, and this assumption is known as the *constant force assumption*. Let's consider the case in which age is the only explanatory variable, and thus, under the constant force assumption we have that

$$
_sq_x=F_x(s)=\frac{S_0(x)-S_0(x+s)}{S_0(x)}=\frac{\exp\left\{-\int_0^x \mu_t\;dt \right\}-\exp\left\{-\int_0^{x+s} \mu_t\;dt \right\}}{\exp\left\{-\int_0^x \mu_t\;dt \right\}}=1-\exp\left\{-\int_x^{x+s} \mu_t\;dt \right\}=1-e^{-\mu^*_{x} \cdot s}
$$
and 

$$
_sp_x=\exp\left\{-\int_x^{x+s} \mu_t\;dt\right\}=e^{-\mu^*_x \cdot s}
$$
for all $0\le s\le 1$, where $\mu^*_{x}$ is the constant force of mortality over the ages $x$ and $x+1$. In turn, one may get that

$$
m_{x}=\frac{q_x}{\int_0^1 {_tp_x}\;dt}=\frac{1-e^{-\mu^*_x}}{\int_0^1 e^{-\mu^*_x \cdot t}\;dt}=\frac{1-e^{-\mu^*_x}}{\big(1-e^{-\mu^*_x}\big)/\mu^*_x}=\mu^*_x.
$$
  
The fractional age assumptions allow us to determine the one year death probability curve, and under the constant force assumption, one may estimate the one death probabilities as follows:

$$
q_x\approx 1-e^{-\mu^*_{x}}\approx 1-e^{-m_x}\quad\text{for all integers}\quad x.
$$

### Select-and-Ultimate Life Tables
  
### Cohort Life Tables and Mortality Improvement Modeling {#S:LifeTabMImpr}

$\color{red}{\text{[Vali:] No changes are made in this subsection.}}$

The fundamental issue e.g. when compiling a life table as we did here relying on one year of mortality data, we are relying on the snapshot of the year 2014 mortality experience. For a life insurance company selling annuities, in order to adequately price and reserve for their future liabilities, it is necessary to take into account future changes in mortality.  As we have seen above, life expectancies have changed substantially over the last decades.  This means that an eighty-year-old today may not have the same $q_{80}$ as an eighty-year-old twenty years from now, which is the relevant $q_{80}$ when selling an annuity to a sixty-year-old today...

One way of describing how mortality changed across years and ages are so-called *mortality improvement factors*, i.e. the percentage reduction in the mortality rate for each age $x$ over successive years ($t-1$ to $t$):

$$
\varphi(x,t) = 1 - \frac{q_x(t)}{q_x(t-1)}.
$$

Since we consider data in five-year intervals, we scale to one year:

$$
\varphi(x,t) = 1 - \left(\frac{q_x(t)}{q_x(t-5)}\right)^{1/5}.
$$
To obtain an impression, let's evaluate in the context of our mortality data. One way of visualizing is a so-called heat map.  As detailed in study note, patterns on the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal dimension relate to year, age, and cohort effects. 

```{r}
us_mx_fem <- us_mx[,-c(2,5,6)]
colnames(us_mx_fem)[colnames(us_mx_fem)=="Female"] <- "mx"
us_mx_fem$qx <- 1-exp(-us_mx_fem$mx)

phi <- matrix(rep(0,111*15),nrow=111,ncol=15,byrow = TRUE)
for (t in 1:15){
  for (x in 1:111){
    phi[x,t] <- 1 - (us_mx_fem[t*111+x,4]/us_mx_fem[(t-1)*111+x,4])^(1/5)
  }
}
heatmap(phi,Colv = NA,Rowv = NA)
```

Diagonals = cohort effects!

One simple way of forecasting mortality into the future are so-called *single factor mortality improvement models*, i.e. models where $\varphi(x,t)$ only depends on $x$ -- let's write $\varphi_x$.  With that, the above equation becomes:

$$
q_x(t)= q_x(t-1)\times (1- \varphi_x),
$$
or, generalizing:

$$
q_x(t) = q_x(0)\times (1-\varphi_x)^t
$$

To obtain suitable improvement factors, let's average across years under consideration:  
  
```{r}
phi_x <- rep(0,111)
for (x in 1:111){
  phi_x[x] <- mean(phi[x,])
}
```

And let's plot to check them out, and include smoothed version:

```{r}
ages <- 1:111
lo <- loess(phi_x ~ ages)
plot(phi_x, type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "red", main="mortality improvement factors", xlab = "age", ylab = "phi")
lines(predict(lo), col='blue', lwd=2)
phi_x <- predict(lo)
```

Using smoothed.

We can get a life table for a sixty-year-old in 2015 by applying the improvement factors to forecast future mortality probabilities using the relationship above:

```{r}
q_50plusx <- rep(0,61)
for (i in 1:61){
q_50plusx[i] <- us_mx_fem_2014[50+i,4] * (1 - phi_x[50+i])^(i-1)
}
```

And let's compare the resulting $q_x$, the ones for 2015 across all ages above 60 and the forecasted cohort mortalities for the 60-year-old in 2015:
  
```{r}
plot(q_50plusx, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "red", main="q_x comparison", xlab = "age")
lines(us_mx_fem_2014[51:111,4], col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```

Evaluate life expectancy at 50:

```{r}
kP50_i <- rep(0,61)
kP50_i[1] <- 1 
for (i in 2:61){
  kP50_i[i] <- kP50_i[i-1] * (1 - q_50plusx[i-1])
}

plot(kP50,xlab="age", type = "l", lwd = 5, col = "red")
lines(kP50_i, col = "blue", lwd = 2)

sum(kP50) - 0.5
sum(kP50_i) - 0.5
```

## Non-parametric survival estimation {#S:NonParamSurv}

Simple parametric mortality models have been discussed in the previous section, which are excellent pedagogical survival models that helped the reader to get a glimpse of more realistic survival models that are about to be gradually introduced. The current section is meant to briefly introduce the two most commonly used non-parametric survival function estimators, known as *Kaplan-Meier* and *Nelson-Aalen*. Estimating the entire survival function for a certain age would simply provide the mortality rates of those at that age over any period of interest, and therefore, actuarial computations/estimations could be performed based on these two estimators. Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen are estimators that are designed for truncated and censored data, which is the case in survival analysis. The analysis of this section is based on the synthetic data `SyntheticInsurerData.csv` described in Section \@ref(S:IndivMortData), where many policies were issued by an life insurer from January 1955 to December 2019 for policyholders aged 19 to 65. Any given policy may raise a claim -- shown in the data feature named *Claim* -- where the death event is recorded, and thus, this data entry is *non-censored*; if the claim is not raised, then the policyholder is alive by the end of teh observation period, i.e. $31^{st}$ of December 2019, and in turn, this datum is *right-censored* as the death event has not yet occurred. In summary, we essentially retain the entry age of each policyholder -- age at the time the policyholder buys the policy -- and the event time that could be the death event for non-censored datum and survival event for censored-datum. For example, a policyholder of age $33$ buys a policy in early January 1990, i.e. her/his *Month_of_Sale* record would be $421$ -- recall that month $780$ indicates that a policy is bought in December 2019 -- while *Sex* feature record would be $0$ and $1$ for a female and male policyholder, respectively; if the policyholder survives by the end of the observation period, then a censored datum is recorded as $+30$ where the plus sign flags the censoring event, and if the policyholder dies 13 years and 2 months after, then a censored datum is recorded with an event time $13+2/12\approx13.17$, i.e. no plus sign is needed for non-censored datum.

Providing the mathematical formulations of these two non-parametric estimators is beyond of the scope this brief introduction to survival analysis, and instead, the aim of this section is familiarize the reader with various standard mortality models by capturing the intuitive behind each model rather than focusing on the mathematical modeling aspects of survival analysis; a short, but informative description of these two estimator could be found at  [Loss Data Analysis descriptions](https://openacttexts.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/C-ModelSelection.html#nonparametric-estimation-using-modified-data). For this reason, we only provide some pictorial representations of the *Kaplan-Meier* estimates and its derivatives in Figure \@ref(fig:KMFigs), which are based on the synthetic data given in `SyntheticInsurerData.csv`. The dataset has a large sample size, and some computations could show that the differences between the *Kaplan-Meier* and *Nelson-Aalen* estimates are insignificant; this is not surprising, since the two estimators are asymptotically equivalent -- for large samples, the estimators are supposed to provide the same results -- and therefore, we do not plot any Nelson–Aalen estimates. The `R` code from below uses the `survfit` function with an argument of `type='kaplan-meier'` for Kaplan-Meier estimates, but one could recover the Nelson–Aalen estimates by setting `type='fleming-harrington'`, and we leave this exercise to the reader.

Figure \@ref(fig:KMFigs) tells us that females are more likely to survive over the same period than males, which is not surprising. The curves for all genders are closer to the equivalent curves based on the male data, since the synthetic dataset has $70\%$ male policyholders, as explained in the data summary given in Section \@ref(S:IndivMortData). The three set of plots from Figure \@ref(fig:KMFigs) use a log scale, and show that that males aged $30$ have a rapid increasing in the mortality rate over the first the 10 to 12 years than females aged $30$ with an opposite behavior for periods longer than 20 years; this is common sense and agrees with the equivalent curves shown for individuals of age $40$ and $50$. 

##	Conditional models: Survival regression {#S:SurvReg}

As introduced in Section \@ref(S:IndivMortData), individual *survival* or *event* data that an insurance company has available consists of *features* or *covariates* $x_i$ for each individual $i$, plus the death time $T_i$ if the individual had died or -- if that's not the case -- the information that the individual is still alive. 

parametric models; proportional hazard (Cox) model; additive model
